  GILES (V.O.)
    Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
  1     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Dawn's standing in front of the three girls Giles brought with him. The three 
    girls are lined up against the wall, and Dawn's inspecting them, arms crossed 
    in front of her. Willow, Anya, Xander, Buffy and Giles are also in the room, 
    gathered for a pow-wow.
  BUFFY
    The First. That's what it wants.
  GILES
    To erase all the slayers in training and their watchers, along with their 
    methods.
  Cut to:
  2     EXT.     OUTSIDE 
    AN APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
    Holding the young woman in an embrace, Spike rears back in vampire face and 
    sinks his fangs into her neck. He drops the woman to the ground and turns 
    his bloody, fanged face to the camera.
  WILLOW (V. O.)
    Buffy, he's been feeding... 
  Cut to:
  3     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    HOUSE - NIGHT
    Spike is sitting in a chair, wrapped in a blanket while the others talk in 
    an adjacent room. Buffy, Xander, Anya, Willow and Dawn are all there. Spike's 
    listening to them.
  BUFFY
    He really didn't know what he'd done. It wasn't in his control.
  Cut to:
  4     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Xander's explaining his ideas to the gang.
  XANDER
    It's a trigger. It's a brainwashing term. It's how the military makes sleeper 
    agents.
  Cut to:
  5     EXT.     FRONT 
    DOOR AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Willow answers the front door—it's Amy.
  WILLOW
    Amy. 
  AMY
    Can I come in?
  WILLOW
    If you really are my friend, you better stay away from me.
  Cut to:
  6     INT.     THE INITIATIVE 
    SUNNYDALE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT
    Dressed in military garb, Riley Finn talks with Professor Walsh, surrounded 
    by other operatives.
  PROFESSOR WALSH
    Agent Finn, my implant?
  RILEY
    The implant works. Hostile 17 can't harm any living creature in any way without 
    intense neurological pain.
  Show clips of Spike being operated on by the Initiative, being kept prisoner 
    there, and being unable to bite a girl due to screaming fits and a headache 
    when he attempts it.
  Cut to:
  7     EXT.     BUFFY'S 
    BACKYARD - DAY
    While in her backyard talking to Xander, Buffy's approached by an angry, gun-toting 
    Warren.
  WARREN
    You think you can just do that to me?
  Warren shoots at Buffy. Meanwhile, while running away, Warren fires a 
    random shot that goes through the upstairs window into Willow and Tara's bedroom. 
    
  Cut to:
  8     INT.     WILLOW 
    AND TARA'S BEDROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE- DAY
    Tara is shot and falls to the floor. Blood spatters Willow's shirt.
  WILLOW
    Tara? 
  Willow is grief-stricken. She is holding Tara's dead body, and when she 
    looks up to heaven, her eyes turn red and black with dark magic because of 
    her anger.
  Cut to:
  9     EXT.     WOODS 
    SOMEWHERE IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT
    Warren is strung up between a pair of trees. He is tied at four points, splayed 
    out like the famous DaVinci diagram. Warren calls for help.
  WARREN
    Somebody! Help!
  Willow, in full dark magic splendor (black hair, black eyes), motions 
    her hand toward Warren, and with a twist of her wrist, removes his skin. Warren 
    screams in agony.
  Cut to:
  10     INT.     STAIRCASE 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Walking with Kennedy, Willow's holding a stack of bed sheets. 
  WILLOW
    You wanna do the sleeping arrangements? (offers the sheets to Kennedy)
  KENNEDY
    (takes the sheets) OK. You, uh, better not hog the covers. (smiles)
  Fade to black.

    The Start Of Episode
  
  PROLOGUE:
  11     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Giles scurries into the living room, where Buffy and Dawn are sitting on the 
    couch.
  GILES
    Are you sure you'll all be all right?
  DAWN
    You'll only be gone for two days. 
  BUFFY
    I think we've managed a bit longer than that.
  GILES
    Right. (looks around nervously, stops) Oh, Dawn, Vi's left her notebook on 
    the mantelpiece. Would you mind running it out to the car?
  DAWN
    (stands, goes to the fireplace) Sure.
  GILES
    While you're at it, you smack her in the head with it and remind her not to 
    leave it lying around.
  DAWN
    (walks out the front door with the notebook) On it.
  GILES
    (sits on coffee table in front of Buffy) I'm just a bit twitchy about leaving 
    you alone again here while—while things are (takes of glasses, wipes 
    his brow) in such a state of flux.
  BUFFY
    I know. But you should go. This trip is important for the girls to understand 
    the source of their power, and to know how to use it right.
  GILES
    Do you think they appreciate the gravity of what we're undertaking? It's frightening, 
    and it's difficult. And then, apparently, someone told them that the vision 
    quest consists of me driving them to the desert, doing the hokey pokey until 
    a spooky Rasta-mama slayer arrives and speaks to them in riddles. (looks at 
    Buffy)
  BUFFY
    (looks innocent) That's not exactly how I put it, I— (sees Willow come 
    down stairs and enter the room) Hey, how's Kennedy?
  WILLOW
    Still fluey. Bummed about missing the field trip. (to Giles) She says she 
    wants you to meditate extra hard for her and to bring her back some smores. 
    (grins)
  GILES
    Ah yes. Smores. I'm going to end up singing campfire songs aren't I? (stands)
  BUFFY
    Oh yeah.
  XANDER
    (comes in the front door, followed by Dawn) Giles, you might want to get out 
    there.
  GILES
    Oh, God, what?
  DAWN
    Molly and Rona are fighting over who gets to drive the first leg.
  BUFFY
    (to Giles) Bet you wish you renewed that California state driver's license 
    now, huh?
  ANYA
    (comes in the front door) Rona won. You should probably let Molly out of the 
    trunk. (car horn blows outside, Anya walks to the kitchen with Willow) I never 
    actually realized just how compact Molly really is.
  GILES
    (sighs, to Buffy) Please be safe while I'm away.
  BUFFY
    You too.
  Cut to:
  12     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Buffy walks downstairs to the basement, toward where Spike is sitting on a 
    cot, his wrists chained to the wall.
  BUFFY
    Hey.
  SPIKE
    Hey.
  BUFFY
    Giles is off ...on the retreat.
  SPIKE
    Give us all a chance for a breather, eh?
  BUFFY
    From Giles?
  SPIKE
    From the constant pitter patter of clomping teenage girly feet.
  BUFFY
    (shrugs) I have no idea what you're talking about. 
  SPIKE
    Come on.
  BUFFY
    No, I enjoy my responsibility as mentor, role model, life guide—oh, my 
    God, I cannot believe I have my bathroom all to myself for two whole days. 
    (sits on the cot beside Spike) 
  SPIKE
    (leans forward) It's like a bloody war-zone up there, and not in a good way.
  BUFFY
    Have you seen the kitchen since they've been here?
  SPIKE
    I'm just trying to stay out of their way.
  BUFFY
    (glances at his chains) I noticed.
  SPIKE
    (looks at his chains) This is better. Believe me, it's safer.
  BUFFY
    OK. But you've been fine. In close contact with the girls.
  SPIKE
    (looks at Buffy) With you by my side, yeah. You won't let me hurt one of them. 
    And that's the way it's gonna be until we're sure the First is done making 
    me its bitch. Either we're together, or I'm on the leash.
  BUFFY
    We just need to make sure the trigger's deactivated then. We've got a couple 
    of days, lack of pitter-patter and all...
  SPIKE
    (leans forward, looking at her earnestly) Buffy...
  BUFFY
    What?
  SPIKE
    Ow.
  BUFFY
    Ow?
  SPIKE
    (his face contorts, twitching) Ow ow ow! (leans back, thrashes against the 
    wall)
  BUFFY
    What's wrong? (Spike puts his hands to his head) Spike, what is going on?
  SPIKE
    (calmer now) The chip. God. Why would—? (screams) Aaahhh! (holds his 
    hands to his head, writhing in intense pain)

  ACT I:
  13     INT.     KITCHEN 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    A tea kettle whistles as Buffy walks into the kitchen from the basement. Willow's 
    at the stove.
  WILLOW
    Hey. How is he?
  BUFFY
    (sits) Oh, in the "goes" part of "comes and goes."
  WILLOW
    Well there seems to be a definite lack of screaming. That has to be good.
  BUFFY
    You'd think. (Willow pours hot water into a cup) That for the other patient?
  WILLOW
    Yeah. Thought I'd bring her some tea, help her feel better.
  BUFFY
    (smiling, teasingly) Mm-hmm?
  WILLOW
    It's just tea.
  BUFFY
    (giggles, then pauses) Will, how much do you know about the chip?
  WILLOW
    Spike's chip? Well, I remember trying to dig up stuff back then, but, you 
    know, turns out, when a secret government agency studies vampires and puts 
    chips in their brains that keep them from hurting people, they don't really 
    build websites. Why?
  BUFFY
    Even with the chip, Spike was able to hurt all those people when he was brainwashed.
  WILLOW
    Yeah, but he was under the control of the First.
  BUFFY
    Maybe something's wrong with it.
  WILLOW
    The chip is misfiring all on its own, then. Well this'll be fun.
  BUFFY
    Remember when things used to be nice and boring?
  WILLOW
    (shrugs) No. (walks out of the kitchen with tea in hand)
  BUFFY
    (teasingly, calls after her) Have fun...delivering tea...
  WILLOW
    (stops, turns around) OK, not when you make it sound all dirty like that. 
    (mumbles as she heads upstairs) It's just tea.
  Cut to:
  14     INT.     WILLOW'S 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Willow walks into her room to find Kennedy putting on her shoes.
  WILLOW
    Hey, I figured the best thing for a cold is a nice hot cup of...(frowns) boots?
  KENNEDY
    Hey.
  WILLOW
    For someone who's sick, you look surprisingly robust and casual dressy.
  KENNEDY
    Well, the lighting in here is good. Maybe it's just—
  WILLOW
    (shocked) You were never sick!
  KENNEDY
    No...I was never sick.
  WILLOW
    Oh, you are so busted. Xander's gonna have to drive you to the desert and—
  KENNEDY
    Willow, chill. (stands) There's a reason I didn't go. I have a thing. A separate 
    thing.
  WILLOW
    What?
  KENNEDY
    (puts on her coat) Something's coming down. I have my own mission. And I need 
    you help.
  Cut to:
  15     INT.     THE 
    BRONZE NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT
    A band's playing a song on stage.
  BAND
    (singing) So I can be happy again...
  Kennedy and Willow are having a drink (complete with orange wedge and 
    paper umbrella garnishes), sitting at one of the tables, listening to the 
    band.
  WILLOW
    This is a mission?
  KENNEDY
    Oh! Yeah...
  WILLOW
    And the little pink umbrellas are a signal for what? We're not on a mission, 
    are we?
  KENNEDY
    Hey, trust me, I told you. I have a thing. (Willow gets up to leave, Kennedy 
    calls after her) Come on, come on. Just hang out with me a little. (Willow 
    turns to face her, sighing) You're sexy when you pout.
  WILLOW
    Why do you do that?
  KENNEDY
    (pouts) To get you to stay.
  WILLOW
    (returns to the table, sits) All right, I'll stay for one drink, then I'm 
    going home.
  KENNEDY
    OK. One drink. I can work with that. Let's start with the easy stuff. How 
    long have you known? That you're gay.
  WILLOW
    Wait. That's easy? (fidgets) And you just assume that I'm—I'm gay. I 
    mean, presume much?
  KENNEDY
    (grins) OK. How long have you enjoyed having sex with women?
  WILLOW
    (taken aback) Hey! (Kennedy chuckles) What you think you have some special 
    lesbidar or something?
  KENNEDY
    OK, you know there's a better word for that, right? (Willow sips her drink) 
    You really haven't been getting out there much, have you?
  WILLOW
    Well, I just—can you always tell just—just by looking at someone?
  KENNEDY
    No. No, of course not. That wouldn't be any fun. The fun part is the process 
    of—of getting to know a girl. It's like—it's like flirting in code. 
    It's using body language and laughing at the right jokes and—and looking 
    into her eyes and knowing she's still whispering to you, even when she's not 
    saying a word. And that sense that if you can just touch her just once everything 
    will be OK for both of you. That's how you can tell. (sits back, grins) Or 
    if she's really hot, you just get her drunk—see if she comes on to you.
  WILLOW
    Three years ago. That's when I knew. And it wasn't women, it was woman. Just 
    one. 
  KENNEDY
    Lucky woman. (smiles)
  Cut to:
  16     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Spike's lying on the cot on his back, resting his head on a pillow. His nose 
    is bleeding. Buffy sits by him.
  SPIKE
    Popped another blood vessel, I think. (Buffy hands him a towel; he wipes blood 
    from his nose)
  BUFFY
    There's gotta be a reason why the chip is going all wonky. Maybe it's related 
    to the trigger or maybe it has something to do with the new soul.
  SPIKE
    Or maybe I wasn't meant to last this long. (beat) One more thing you and I 
    have in common, eh, pet?
  BUFFY
    Well, we'll fix it. We'll hit serious research mode—
  SPIKE
    Good. Try Behavioral Modification Software Throughout the Ages.
  BUFFY
    (sighs) OK. You're right. Not a book thing. It's a phone thing.
  SPIKE
    Who you gonna call? (Buffy looks at him funny) God, that phrase is never gonna 
    be useable again, is it?
  BUFFY
    Doubt it.
  Cut to:
  17     INT.     THE 
    BRONZE NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT
    Kennedy and Willow are having a drink together, talking.
  KENNEDY
    Do your parents know?
  WILLOW
    Yeah. My mom was—was all proud like I was making some political statement. 
    Then the statement mojo wore off and I was just gay. She hardly ever even 
    met Tara. 
  KENNEDY
    Classic.
  WILLOW 
    I didn't mind. Tara and I are kind of private.
  KENNEDY
    I'm sorry. It must've—
  WILLOW
    Were, I mean. Private.
  Cut to:
  18     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Buffy's talking on the phone while Spike sits on the stairs behind her.
  BUFFY
    Yes, Agent Finn, Riley. Tell him we're having a problem with Spike's chip. 
    No his chip. Spike. 
  SPIKE
    (shakes his head) Listen, pet?
  BUFFY
    No, no, Finn is his last name. Yeah. Well, did he used to work there and then 
    he got transferred? (Spike's chip goes off again, he thrashes on the stairs 
    unnoticed by Buffy) Oh, is this actually a flower shop, or is this one of 
    those things where I'm supposed to play along to show that I know it's really 
    secret ops? Oh, maybe I shouldn't have said that. Oh, OK, right. Well, if 
    some guy named Finn shows up to buy flowers— Yeah. Thanks. (hangs up, 
    turns to Spike) Wrong number. Or a giant government conspiracy, one or the— 
    (notices he's recovering from an episode) Spike?
  SPIKE
    This one seemed easier than the others. See? Probably just gonna fade— 
    (screams, holding his head again)
  Cut to:
  19     INT.     THE 
    BRONZE NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT
    Kennedy and Willow are having a drink together, talking.
  KENNEDY
    It was Gone with the Wind. I saw that, and I knew I wanted to sweep 
    Scarlet off her feet.
  WILLOW
    You were five.
  KENNEDY
    Well, I'm not saying the sweeping would have been easy... (smiles, eats the 
    cherry off her paper umbrella garnish) What?
  WILLOW
    I just—I still don't get it. (shrugs) Why you like me. I mean, you don't 
    even know me. 
  KENNEDY
    Have you seen you? (Willow blushes) And we like the same things—Italian, 
    skate punk, Robert Parker mysteries, fighting evil...
  WILLOW
    (smiles, shakes her head) I don't like any of that stuff. Except the—the 
    fighting evil part. Even then, I prefer a nice foot massage.
  KENNEDY
    OK, I dig the way you always turn off the Moulin Rouge DVD at Chapter 32 so 
    it has a happy ending. (Willow laughs) I like the way you speak. It's interesting. 
    (Willow smiles) And your freckles...likeable. (Willow blushes) I'm not so 
    into the magic stuff. It seems like fairy tale crap to me, but if it matters 
    to you... You care about it, so it's cool. 
  Cut to:
  20     INT.     WILLOW'S 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Willow walks into her bedroom, Kennedy waits at the door. The mood is very 
    awkward.
  WILLOW
    Well, this is my stop. (turns on light) So...glad we talked. 
  KENNEDY
    (walks into the room, toward Willow, nods) Yes. Kinda cleared the air.
  WILLOW
    (nods) Yeah, totally. Air cleared. Check. 
  KENNEDY
    (standing in front of Willow now) You know, in the spirit of air clearing...
  WILLOW
    Yeah?
  KENNEDY
    I feel like I need to be honest about something.
  WILLOW
    I-is something wrong?
  KENNEDY
    No. (shakes head) No, it's just— (walks closer to Willow) I think (leans 
    in for a kiss) you should know... 
  Kennedy kisses Willow slowly, passionately. The camera circles them as 
    they kiss, showing Willow's hair, then Kennedy's hair—then Willow's hair 
    is gone as the kiss ends. Where Willow was, Warren's now standing.
  WARREN
    Well, that was nice.
  Kennedy pulls back from him, panicked. She stumbles and falls as she retreats, 
    knocking over a lamp.
  Fade to black.
  ACT II:
  21     INT.     WILLOW'S 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Resume. Willow's standing where Warren was a moment ago, talking to Kennedy, 
    who is staring incredulously at her.
  WILLOW
    Are you OK? (chuckles nervously) I'm not used to literally knocking girls 
    off of their feet with just the power of my own lips. 
  Kennedy just stares at Willow, confused.
  WARREN
    OK, you gonna pick that up, or...?
  KENNEDY
    I don't—what are you?
  WILLOW
    Is this a freckle thing, 'cause— 
  Willow starts to panic and goes to look in the mirror; she sees Warren's 
    reflection instead of her own.

  WILLOW/WARREN*
    Oh, God! Oh, God...
  KENNEDY
    What... is that?
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    (feeling his face) It's the man that I killed.

  22     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Warren comes down the stairs, followed by Kennedy. Xander, Anya and Dawn are 
    in the living room. 
  KENNEDY
    OK, hold up a sec.
  When Xander, Anya and Dawn see Warren, they gasp and stand, positioning 
    themselves defensively.
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    Guys—
  XANDER
    Get Buffy. Get Buffy. Tell her the First is back.
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    No, I'm not the First.
  ANYA
    We're not interested in any of your evil lies. We've heard 'em all.
  WILLOW*/WARREN
    No, guys it's me. 
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    I'm me. I'm Willow. Guys, come on. As Kennedy— (points to Kennedy) she 
    was there.
  KENNEDY
    (shakes her head) I don't know. I'm not sure. We were up in Willow's room 
    and we were—-
  Carrying a bowl of food, Andrew walks into the living room. When he sees 
    Warren, he freezes in place, dropping his bowl; it shatters to pieces on the 
    ground.
  ANDREW
    No... No. You're back.
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    (emphatic) No, I'm not. It's not— I'm not it. Listen to me—
  ANDREW
    No more listening. I know who you are now. I know what you made me do. Your 
    promises of happy fields and dancing schnauzers and being demigods won't work 
    on me anymore.
  ANYA
    (yells) Buffy!
  XANDER
    (whispers, to Anya) The Bringers are coming too.
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    No, I'm not the First.
  ANDREW
    You made me do things. Things I can never take back. Ever. 
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    I'm not the First.
  BUFFY
    (walks into the room) What the hell is going on here—? (scowls when she 
    sees Warren, punches him in the nose. He falls to the ground, writhing in 
    pain on the floor) Ow! (stares at Warren)
  SPIKE
    (walks into the room, holding his head) Buffy...
  ANYA
    Wait.
  DAWN
    But if he's the First...
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    I'm not the First.
  XANDER
    You're not the First. 
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    (stands) I know.
  ANDREW
    (smiles) Oh, my God! (goes to Warren) You're back. (hugs Warren from behind, 
    his hands touching Warren's chest)
  WILLOW*/WARREN
    (grabs Andrew's hands) Hey, (turns to face him) bad touching! 
  Spike wanders around, holding his head, moaning in pain while everyone 
    stares at Willow/Warren.
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    Everyone please stop it.
  KENNEDY
    It's Willow.
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    I'm Willow.
  XANDER
    Are you sure?
  WILLOW*/WARREN
    There are other stories from kindergarten. Non yellow crayon stories in which 
    you don't come out in such a good light. 
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    An incident involving Aquaman underoos, for example. You want me to start 
    talking?
  XANDER
    (smiles, walks up to Willow/Warren) Hey, Willow!
  ANYA
    What happened?
  Everyone inches closer to Willow/Warren.
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    I don't know. We were there, and then I looked like him.
  ANYA
    Oh, like a glamour.
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    Maybe, but I probably brought it on myself.
  BUFFY
    What makes you think that?
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    Well, it wouldn't be the first time. I have a history with my witchy subconscious 
    making things go kerfloopey. Remember the wacky "I can't see you, you 
    can't see me" spell?
  While Willow/Warren's talking, Dawn touches his shoulder, Andrew touches 
    his chest and face.
  BUFFY
    (to Dawn and Andrew) Guys!
  ANDREW
    (stops touching Willow/Warren) It's so real.
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    I'm all too aware. (brushes Dawn's hand away.
  BUFFY
    OK, say you're right, and you did do this to yourself. Why would your subconscious 
    turn you into Warren?
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    Obviously because I feel bad—about killing him.
  BUFFY
    We'll deal. We'll get help.
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    No, I can handle this.
  BUFFY
    On your own? Why?
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    I did it. I'll fix it. I don't want you seeing me this way anyway. (walks 
    toward the door)
  BUFFY
    It's kinda a little late for that. (Spike's moaning in the background)
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    Seriously, I'm not posing any big threat to the world. Looks like you've got 
    your hands full already. 
  Buffy looks around, sees Spike lying on the floor moaning and twitching.
  WILLOW*/WARREN
    I'll go, I'll handle it, I'll fix it, I'll be back before you even know I'm 
    gone. 
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    Promise. (leaves through the front door) 
  BUFFY
    (goes to his side) Spike. (kneels down beside him)
  SPIKE
    Buffy.
  BUFFY
    I'm right here.
  SPIKE
    The chip fired again.
  Xander, Anya, Dawn and Andrew gather around to watch Buffy and Spike. 
    Kennedy sneaks out the front door unnoticed. 
  BUFFY
    I kinda figured. Maybe they'll call back. Maybe they'll send help.
  SPIKE
    Maybe we can't wait.

  KENNEDY
    OK. Safe to say no one will ever accuse you of being too butch.
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    Kennedy, go home. (walks away)
  KENNEDY
    (follows) Come on. I mean, you turned into a guy. I mean if you take a step 
    back, seriously, there's a certain element of humor here, right? (Willow/Warren 
    stops walking, turns and glares at her) Well, a really, really big step.
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    I killed him. It's hard to see the chuckles. (walks away)
  KENNEDY
    (follows) So you got a plan?
  WILLOW*/WARREN
    Yeah, get some help reversing it.
  KENNEDY
    I thought you were gonna try it yourself.
  WILLOW*/WARREN
    I did try. Something's blocking me.
  KENNEDY
    All the more reason for me to go with you. Plus, I was there when it happened. 
    Lemme come to try to help too.
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    (stops walking) I really think I'm fine with the handling.
  KENNEDY
    By yourself? Why?
  WILLOW*/WARREN
    I'm the one that killed him. I— It's hard to understand. 
  KENNEDY
    Given. How 'bout I just tag along anyway. Keep you company. (Willow/Warren 
    sighs) I'm taking that as a yes.
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    (walks) Fine. Come. 
  WILLOW*/WARREN
    Try not to get in the way.
  KENNEDY
    You know where you're going?
  WILLOW*/WARREN

  BUFFY
    Eh, nothing good on TV tonight.
  SPIKE
    (stops walking) Here we are.
    Yep, here we are. (they kneel on the ground) You think the stuff's still good?
  SPIKE
    I don't know. (digs through the dirt) Worked pretty good when the Initiative 
    held me captive here. Every time I'd get a little...rambunctious, the chip'd 
    kick in. I feel like my head was gonna explode. They'd dope me up, and everything 
    would be all daffodils and teddy bears. For a couple of hours anyway.
  BUFFY
    Maybe we should search for files and stuff. Find out everything we can about 
    the chip—shelf life.
  SPIKE
    I'll take whatever I can get. (grabs a chain in the dirt)
  BUFFY

  ANDREW
    I'll get it. (stands) I'm supposed to get a call when the new League of Extraordinary 
    Gentlemen comes in. I gave them this number.
  XANDER
    Ooh. Can you see if you can get two?
  ANDREW
    Summers residence, this is Andrew speaking. How can I help you?
  XANDER
    (realizes that Dawn and Anya are staring at him, looks at Andrew) Loser.
  ANDREW
    (holds his hand over the phone) Hey, do we know some British guy named Robson?
  Time passes. Xander hangs up the phone and reports to Dawn and Anya.
  XANDER
    He was attacked, this Robson guy in England. (sits) And Giles was there helping 
    him. And there was a Bringer. 
  ANYA
    (leans forward) Xander...
  XANDER
    Robson blacked out, but the last thing he remembers is Giles's head about 
    to get really familiar with a Bringer's very sharp axe. 
  DAWN
    Oh, my God! 
  ANYA
    Giles never mentioned any of this.
  XANDER
    Robson said by the time he came to, there was no Giles.
  DAWN
    So, what are we saying?
  XANDER
    Maybe Giles just didn't want to talk about it.
  ANYA
    Or maybe he didn't make it. Look, I'm not saying it's a happy scenario, but 
    we're dealing with a big bad that can be any dead person it wants. 
  XANDER
    Because if you want to infiltrate the inner circle of the slayer...
  ANYA
    Become the one person she trusts more than anybody else.
  DAWN
    But there's no way that we can know.
  ANDREW
    Actually that's not true. The First can't take corporeal form, so it can't 
    touch anything.
  ANYA
    Oh, it's not like Giles hasn't touched anything, right? (thinks, looks expectantly 
    at everyone else) Ha-has anyone seen Giles touch anything since he got back? 
    Hold anything? Has anybody hugged him? Think very hard.
  Xander stands and walks toward the door. Anya and Dawn follow.
  ANDREW

  XANDER
    The desert. We're gonna find Giles.
  ANDREW
    Oh good. Let me just get some tapes for the car. I've been working on this 
    mix—
  XANDER
    You're not coming.
  ANDREW
    What? Why? 'Cause I used to be evil?
  XANDER
    No, actually, 'cause you're annoying, but that's a good reason too. (turns 
    toward the door)
  ANDREW
    (panicked) Wait, I—don't leave me here alone. I keep getting attacked 
    in this house.
  DAWN
    Actually, Xand...
  ANDREW
    What if this is all part of the plan? Drive you guys away so it can have its 
    way with me? Ever think of that?
  XANDER
    I'll risk it. (puts his hand on the doorknob)
  ANDREW
    OK, well, if you leave me here alone, I'll do something evil, like burning 
    something or gluing things together.
  ANYA
    For crying out loud, Harris, let's just take him. At least we can keep an 
    eye on him. (Xander waves to Andrew to join them; Andrew and Dawn go out the

    Oh, hey. I'm sorry—Willow. We actually met when I was a Freshman. And 
    also not a boy. This is Kennedy.
  KENNEDY
    Hey.
  CIRCLE LEADER
    You're Willow?
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    Yeah. Wow, look at you guys. Campus Wiccans. Guess you got past the whole

    Uh, no, we still do that too. Second Tuesday of every month. I'm sorry, I'm

  WILLOW*/WARREN
    OK. Whoa...
  WOMAN/AMY
    OK, here's the thing. Hi. Here's the thing. I'll just get this out of the

    it. Gotcha. 
  CIRCLE LEADER
    But she's doing so much better now. Amy...
  AMY
    It's OK, Vaughne, I wanna do this. It took me a long time to really see myself. 
    But I did. Because you know that's the crazy thing about hitting rock bottom, 
    you get to relive all the crappy things you did. And I wanted to come find 
    you and tell you that I was here working on things with these guys. And that 
    they're good. And that I'm sorry. But you're here, looking like— Wow. 
    How did this happen?
  KENNEDY
    That's what we're here to find out. I mean, if we're done with all the group 
    hugging.
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    I got hit with this, like, glamour thing, and I can't seem to shake it myself. 
    I was hoping someone here might be able to help.

    Yeah, see the thing is we're more about healing spirits and nurturing our

  KENNEDY
    (walks back up to Amy) OK, and that's magic crazy talk for what?
  AMY
    (smirking) I put a hex on her.
  KENNEDY
    I got that part. But why Warren? And why did it happen after we kissed?
  AMY
    Oh, (chuckles) that's rich. (slinks closer to Kennedy) That must've been some 
    kiss. You must be good.
  KENNEDY
    Answer me.
  AMY
    The hex I cast lets the victim's subconscious pick the form of their punishment. 
    It's always better than anything I can come up with. Elegant, you know?
  KENNEDY
    (threateningly) Undo it. Let her out.
  AMY
    OK. Oh, wait, I forgot—no.
  KENNEDY
    Why would you do this to her? You really hate her that much?
  AMY
    (sighs) This is not about hate. It's about power. Willow always had all the 
    power, long before she even knew what to do with it. Just came so easy for 
    her. The rest of us—we had to work twice as hard to be half as good. 
    But no one cares about how hard you work. They just care about cute, sweet 
    Willow. They don't know how weak she is. She gave in to evil—stuff worse 
    than I can even imagine— She almost destroyed the world! And yet everyone 
    keeps on loving her? (in Kennedy's face) So what's wrong with having a little 
    fun, huh? Taking her down a peg or two?
  KENNEDY
    Fun? (Amy nods) She's disappearing. Fading away in that creep, and you think 
    it's fun.

    It was just a game. It's not my fault if she's losing herself.

    I'm gonna stop you now, you know.
  AMY
    (smirks) Hey, I'm not the bad guy here. But I wonder where he'd be right about 
    now. (snaps her fingers)

  45     EXT.     BUFFY'S 
    BACKYARD - DAY
    Kennedy suddenly finds herself in the backyard of Buffy's house. 
  KENNEDY
    (to herself) Well, that was a hell of a thing.
  Still carrying a handgun, Willow/Warren storms into the backyard through 
    the gate exactly as Warren did the day he shot at Buffy and killed Tara.
  WILLOW*/WARREN
    Think you can just do that to me? That I'd let you get away with it?
  KENNEDY
    Do? Get away with— (Warren/Willow points the gun at Kennedy; Kennedy 
    backs up slowly, calmly) OK, let's not get excited.
  WILLOW*/WARREN
    (walks closer to Kennedy) It's too late for that. This is what I am. I made 
    it happen, and I'll make it stop.
  KENNEDY
    Willow, what did you make happen?
  WILLOW*/WARREN
    You were there, bitch! You saw it! 
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    I killed her.
  KENNEDY
    You mean him?
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    Her, him— (points gun at Kennedy again) You know what I mean.
  KENNEDY
    You said her.
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    No, that was Warren.
  KENNEDY
    No, no it wasn't. You said I was there. Who did you kill, Willow?
  WILLOW*/WARREN
    It was your fault, slut. 
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    You tricked me. Got me to forget.
  KENNEDY
    Tara....
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    Shut up! 
  WILLOW*/WARREN
    (crying) Shut up! You do not get to say her name. Offering it up to whoever's 
    there. Tricking me into kissing you. (looking lost) I didn't—I didn't 
    mean... what I'm saying, I—I can't make— (pleading) Kennedy, I can't 
    hold on... he's winning.
  KENNEDY
    (takes a step toward Willow/Warren) No...
  WILLOW*/WARREN
    I'm being punished. I k—I kissed you just—just for a second, but 
    it was enough. I let her go. I didn't mean to.
  KENNEDY
    Kissing me didn't mean th—
  WILLOW*/WARREN
    No, she was never gone. She was with me. We should have been forever, and 
    I— (cries) I let her be dead. She's really dead. (breaks down into tears) 
    And I killed her. (falls to the ground sobbing)
  KENNEDY
    (goes to Willow/Warren's side) Willow, no.
  WILLOW*/WARREN
    (looking up to the sky) Please, baby, I'm so sorry. 
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    Come back. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Come back... (sobs) 
  KENNEDY
    (kneels in front of Willow/Warren) Willow, I don't think you did anything 
    wrong. This is just magic. And I think I'm figuring the whole magic thing 
    out. It's just like fairy tales. (leans in for a kiss) 
  WILLOW/WARREN*
    (recoils) What are you doing?
  KENNEDY
    Bringing you back to life.
  Kennedy kisses Willow/Warren and the camera circles them as before—alternating 
    between Kennedy's hair and Warren's hair. When the kiss is done, it's Willow's 
    red hair is where Warren's was before. Kennedy sits back and looks at Willow.
  KENNEDY
    (smiles) Hmm. I am good.
  WILLOW
    It's—it's me? (touches her face) I'm back? Oh, God...
  KENNEDY
    Are you all right?
  WILLOW
    I have no idea. (they stand) I'm so tired.
  Kennedy supports Willow and walks her into the house.
  KENNEDY
    Yeah. I'll make you some tea.
