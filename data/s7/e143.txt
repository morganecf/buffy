    Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
  1     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    HOUSE - NIGHT

    Buffy, Faith, and Spike walk into Buffy's house through the front door. Dawn 
    and Giles are at the dining room table.
  FAITH
    Hey.
  GILES
    (stands, nods) Hello, Faith.
  Cut to:

      AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
      Pan out to show that the potential slayers are training in the backyard, 
      being led by Kennedy.
    POTENTIALS
      Huh!
  
  Cut to:

  BUFFY
    They're potential slayers, just like we were. 
  Cut to:
  3     INT.     TRUCK 
    - NIGHT
    The young girl is panting, catching her breath. She's sitting in the passenger's 
    seat in an old truck beside a man dressed as a preacher or priest.

  CALEB
    (wearing a black shirt with priest's collar, speaking in a southern drawl) 
    Call me Caleb. 
  Cut to:
  4     INT.     WINE 
    CELLAR AT THE SHADOW VALLEY VINEYARDS - NIGHT
    Buffy walks down the steps into the wine cellar. With one powerful punch, 
    he sends Buffy flying across the room. A potential with long black hair swings 
    at Caleb, but he grabs her sword, then her face. Caleb snaps the potential's 
    neck and drops her to the ground. Molly sees Caleb kill the potential. Caleb 
    grabs Xander and turns him around so he's facing Caleb. Caleb plunges his 
    thumb into Xander's left eye, gouging it out. Xander screams in agony. Xander, 
    bleeding from his eye, stumbles back, falling to the ground in front of wine 
    barrels.

  Cut to:
  5     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Anya's talking to the gang.
  ANYA
    Look, I'm not saying it's a happy scenario, but we're dealing with a Big Bad 
    that can be any dead person it wants.

  Cut to:
  6     INT.     WINE 
    CELLAR AT THE SHADOW VALLEY VINEYARDS - NIGHT
    Caleb is talking to the First who has taken Buffy's form. Caleb reaches toward 
    her and tries to touch her face, but his hand goes through her head.
  Cut to:
  7     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

    Buffy addresses the meeting of Giles, Dawn, Faith, Willow, Xander, Robin Wood 
    and all the potentials in her living room. Xander is sitting in an overstuffed 
    chair, with Dawn sitting beside him on the arm of the chair. Kennedy is sitting 
    on the sofa, with Willow sitting beside her on the arm of the sofa. Anya is 
    standing beside Willow with her arms crossed.
  BUFFY
    The bad guys always go where the power is. They're protecting the vineyard 
    or something at the vineyard.
  Cut to:
  8     INT.     WINE 
    CELLAR AT THE SHADOW VALLEY VINEYARDS - NIGHT

    Bringers are using welding torches and pick-axes on some stone in a cave under 
    the vineyard. Buffy/First and Caleb look on.
  BUFFY/FIRST
    You realize what will happen if the slayer and her girls get it, don't you?
  CALEB
    They won't.
  Cut to:

  9     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    At the meeting, Dawn walks up to Buffy.
  DAWN
    (stands, walks up to Buffy, softly) We have to be together on this. (Buffy 
    blinks her eyes in disbelief) So I need you to leave. 
  Cut to:

  10     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    The potentials and Scoobies and Dawn, Giles and Faith are down in the basement 
    having another meeting by candlelight. Anya, Xander and Dawn are sitting at 
    a table. The others are gathered around. 
  FAITH
    Now... (stands) I'm your boss.
  Cut to:

  11     INT.     STREET 
    IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT
    Walking alone, her arms crossed, Buffy walks down a desolate street at night 
    looking forlorn and troubled.
  Cut to:
  12     INT.     STRANGER'S 
    HOUSE - NIGHT
    Buffy is sitting on the edge of the bed. Spike is standing up in front of 
    her.

  SPIKE
    (kneels in front of her; looks into her eyes) And there's only one thing I've 
    ever been sure of: you. 
  Spike sits on the bed beside Buffy and puts his arm around her. She curls 
    up on him, cuddling up to his chest as he puts his arm around her shoulder, 
    holding her head with his hand.
  SPIKE (V.O.)
    You're the one, Buffy.
  Cut to:

  13     INT.     WINE 
    CELLAR AT THE SHADOW VALLEY VINEYARDS - DAY
    Caleb and Buffy/First are walking beside each other. Buffy/First has her arms 
    crossed. Caleb and Buffy/First turn to look and see Buffy standing at the 
    top of the stairs. 
  BUFFY
    (cockily, hands on her hips) Hey. Heard you got something of mine.
  Cut to:

  14     INT.     WINE 
    CELLAR AT THE SHADOW VALLEY VINEYARDS - DAY
    Buffy walks up to the rock where the Bringers were working before, and now 
    we see what they were after. Stuck inside the rock is a shiny weapon of some 
    sort—it's got a wide, rounded blade on one end, and a point on the end 
    of the shaft. Buffy's eyes widen as she stares at it in awe. She smiles. 
  Cut to:
  15     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY

    Faith addresses the potentials and others in Buffy's house.
  FAITH
    Those of you who are coming with me to the arsenal, you know who you are. 
    Everybody ready? Let's do this thing. (walks toward the door; some of the 
    potentials follow, armed)
  End Recap.
    
     

  
    The Start Of Episode
  
  PROLOGUE:
  16     INT.     TUNNEL 
    - DAY
    The girls follow Faith down a long, dark hallway. Faith walks over a plank 
    laid across a small waterway and sees a box that's padlocked shut. Faith kicks 
    at the padlock, busting it. She bends down to open the box and finds a timer/detonator 
    reading "00.04" that is wired to a box full of bricks labeled "C4 
    High Explosive." Her eyes widen as it counts down in seconds, beeping 
    as the numbers change:

    00.03 (beep)
    (beep)
    (beep)
  FAITH
    (yelling to the others, and ducking away) Get down!
  The box explodes in a massive fireball sending girls flying through the 
    air.  

  Cut to:
  17     INT.     WINE 
    CELLAR AT THE SHADOW VALLEY VINEYARDS - DAY
    Buffy stares at the shiny weapon stuck in the rock and walks up to it slowly. 
    Caleb opens the hatch and walks down the stairs into the room. Buffy turns 
    to look at him. 
  CALEB
    So...you found it. Not impressed. 'Cause the question now, girly girl, is 
    can you pry it from solid rock before I come over there—

  Buffy grabs the handle and pulls the weapon out of the stone one-handed 
    with ease. She looks it over. 
  CALEB
    (shocked) Hmm. Darn. (exhales worriedly)
  Cut to:
  Opening Credits.
  ACT I:

  18     INT.     WINE 
    CELLAR AT THE SHADOW VALLEY VINEYARDS - DAY
    Resume. Caleb is confronting Buffy in the cellar just as she has pulled the 
    weapon out of the stone.
  CALEB
    Now, before you go hurting yourself with that thing, why don't you do yourself 
    a courtesy and hand it over now?
  BUFFY

    (cocks her head to the side) Yeah? You want it? (hoists the weapon up casually)
  CALEB
    (smiles nervously) You don't even know what you got there. (steps back)
  BUFFY
    I know you're backing away.
  CALEB

    You think wielding some 2-sided doo-dad's gonna make a difference?
  Buffy/First shows up behind Caleb frowning with her arms crossed.
  BUFFY/FIRST
    Let her go, Caleb. (he hesitates) I said let her go.
  CALEB
    If I let her go, she slices me open with that thing.

  BUFFY/FIRST
    No, she doesn't. She hasn't got time. She has friends. (Buffy looks at her 
    worriedly) And her friends are in trouble. Faith go boom.
  CALEB
    I'm not letting her out of here with that thing.
  BUFFY/FIRST
    Sure you are. Then you'll come back for it later...when she's got her back 
    turned.

  Buffy runs out of the cellar carrying the weapon. Caleb and the First 
    watch her go.
  Cut to:
  19     INT.     TUNNEL 
    - DAY
    The air is hazy with dust and debris from the explosion. Girls start moving 
    amid the rubble, crawling around. Amanda grabs a flashlight as she gets to 
    her feet.
  AMANDA

    (calling around) Hey! Hey, Faith! Anybody! Is anybody here?!
  CARIDAD
    (coughs) Me! (stands)
  AMANDA
    (calling out) Is anybody else alive?
  CARIDAD

    Hello? Anyone?
  VI
    I'm—(coughs, then weakly) I'm here!
  Amanda and Caridad go to Vi, who's crouched in a corner. They help her 
    to her feet.
  CARIDAD
    Who else we got?

  VI
    Don't know. 
  AMANDA
    You OK? (they help Vi walk)
  VI
    I think my arm is broken. (sees girls lying under rubble, not moving; Vi stares, 
    shocked) I guess I'm lucky.

  KENNEDY
    (stands) Where's Faith?
  VI
    I don't know.
  KENNEDY
    Find her.

  CARIDAD
    Maybe we should get the hell out of this place. They could—
  KENNEDY
    (emphatically) Find her!
  Amanda and a couple other girls pull Faith's unconscious body out of the 
    water. 
  VI

    (turning away at the sight) Oh, God!
  KENNEDY
    Is she alive?
  AMANDA
    Breathing. Pulse.
  KENNEDY

    We gotta get her out of here.
  VI
    Which way is out?
  AMANDA
    There's other girls. There's more than Faith. We don't even know how many 
    of us are still— (the girls hear a distant growl; everyone stops to look) 
    alive.

  CARIDAD
    What was that?
  VI
    It could've been grinding metal. It could've been—
  KENNEDY
    No, it was one of them.

  CARIDAD
    That's not possible.
  AMANDA
    How'd it get in here? 
  VI
    Plans?

  KENNEDY
    Run.
  The girls run out of the room where the explosion happened and try to 
    escape down the tunnels they came in. 
  CARIDAD
    Oh, no! It's blocked!
  VI

    (crying) Oh, my God!
  AMANDA
    I told you this wasn't the way!
  KENNEDY
    Cut the chatter! Up and over! Wounded first! Let's go!
  The girls climb over the debris blocking the tunnel. With all the wounded 
    girls, it's taking too long. Finally, when the last girl, Vi, comes over the 
    pile, a Turok-Han reaches for her. The girls scream and instinctively back 
    away as they watch it climb over the pile and move toward them.

  KENNEDY
    Group together. Form a circle. Nobody panic. It's all of us, one of him. We 
    can take one of these things.
  As the girls stare at the Turok-Han coming over the pile of debris, another 
    Turok-Han jumps down the steps beside them. 
  Cut to:
  20     INT.     DINING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY

    There's piles and piles of food on the dining room table. Girls reach for 
    the food as Andrew empties it from a duffle bag.
  ANDREW
    It was pretty amazing. A whole grocery store just abandoned. Food lying around 
    everywhere. Uh, the produce was on its way to funky town, but—
  GILES
    Ooh. (grabs desperately for a package) Jaffa cakes. (starts eating the cakes)
  ANDREW

    Uh, the apples still look pretty good, so everyone should, uh, check those 
    out.
  The front door opens and Willow, Dawn, Anya, and Xander walk into the 
    house.
  GILES
    (walks toward the others) Did you find Buffy?
  XANDER
    No.

  Cut to:
  21     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Xander, Anya, Willow, Dawn, Giles and Andrew walk into the living room.
  ANDREW
    But you did that spell with the little lights. The locator.

  ANYA
    It crapped out on us though.
  DAWN
    No, it didn't...exactly.
  WILLOW
    It just took us to an empty house. She must have moved on already.

  GILES
    I'm afraid we have slightly worse news here. Faith hasn't returned with the 
    other girls. Something's gone wrong.
  ANDREW
    I've been here, keeping morale up. Because that's important.
  WILLOW
    (worried) We have to go to her.

  XANDER
    (nods) Guess so.
  ANDREW
    Yes. I'll stay here, keep working on that morale thing. (sips a Capri-Sun 
    drink)
  Cut to:
  22     INT.     TUNNEL 
    - DAY

    The girls stare down the Turok-Han in front of them.
  KENNEDY
    (holding her fists up in front of her) Remember the training. Everybody, get 
    ready! (a Turok-Han sneaks up behind her and grabs her, knocking her down; 
    she screams) Aah!
  AMANDA
    There's another one.
  KENNEDY

    (frees herself from the Turok-Han that attacked her and backs away from it) 
    Move! Move! Move! Up and over! 
  AMANDA
    (to Kennedy) Not that one! (points her toward yet another Turok-Han) That 
    one!
  The girls all scream as the three Turok-Hans advance toward them. They 
    grab one of the girls. 
  CARIDAD
    Weapons! (points) Over there!

  Kennedy runs to the weapons, but the Turok-Han have already begun ripping 
    apart the girl they grabbed. One looks at Kennedy, snarling, his face covered 
    in the girl's blood. It charges toward Kennedy who swings the weapon at the 
    monster, but to no avail. The Turok-Han easily disarms her, grabs her by the 
    neck, and lifts her off the ground choking her.. 
  A loud crash echoes through the room as something falls from the ceiling, 
    allowing light to enter the room from above. Buffy jumps down through the 
    hole into the room carrying the weapon she got from the vineyard earlier. 
    The Turok-Han drops Kennedy and stalks toward Buffy. Buffy swings the weapon 
    at the Turok-Han as it approaches her, and she uses the pointy end to stake 
    first one Turok-Han, then the other. The third Turok-Han approaches her and 
    knocks her down, but Buffy tumbles forward, grabs her weapon, leaps to her 
    feet, and beheads the last Turok-Han, turning it to dust before everyone's 
    eyes. 
  The girls who have been watching her stare incredulously at the sight 
    of Buffy in action. Kennedy is panting, holding her neck. 
  BUFFY
    (looks at the girls) Get the wounded. We're leaving.
  KENNEDY

    Are there more?
  BUFFY
    There's always more. Let's move. (walks out) 
  Fade to black.
  ACT II:
  23     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY

    Buffy's living room has been turned into an impromptu triage unit as the healthy 
    ones treat the wounds of the girls hurt in the explosion. 
  BUFFY
    (sitting next to a wounded girl) Will, come here. She's losing a lot of blood.
  WILLOW
    Got it. (goes to the side of the girl Buffy was attending)
  Giles and Xander carry an unconscious Faith through the front door and 
    up the stairs. Kennedy and Amanda stand in the doorway, concerned, as Buffy 
    goes to supervise. 

  BUFFY
    (to Giles and Xander) The room upstairs is ready for her.
  GILES
    Good.
  XANDER
    I hope we're in time.

  AMANDA
    Is she OK? Is she gonna be OK?
  KENNEDY
    (to Amanda) I'm sure she'll be fine, (to Buffy) right?
  XANDER
    Careful!

  GILES
    Just mind her head.
  BUFFY
    I'll be up in a second.
  KENNEDY
    You guys heal fast, right? You slayers?

  BUFFY
    (goes back to the living room) Yeah.
  KENNEDY
    So...she'll be OK?
  BUFFY
    I don't know.

  CARIDAD
    What's with the axe thing?
  BUFFY
    I took it from Caleb. It might be important.
  VI
    Let's hope.

  AMANDA
    I think we got punished.
  BUFFY
    What?
  KENNEDY
    (nervously) We, uh...we followed her. And it was—

  VI
    It didn't work out.
  BUFFY
    You guys, it was a trap. It's not her fault. That could've just as easily 
    happened to me. (Vi shakes her head) 
  CARIDAD
    So are you... are you, like, back?

  BUFFY
    I don't know. I guess I'm not leaving. (carries a first-aid kit and her new 
    weapon to the stairs)
  KENNEDY
    So, we got a plan now, or anything?
  BUFFY
    Yeah, there's a plan. Get ready. Time's up.

  AMANDA
    (to herself) I still think we got punished.
  Cut to:
  24     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    A couple of the potentials are standing around the edge of the room staring 
    at Faith as Giles and Xander place her on the bed. Giles is taking her pulse. 
    Buffy walks into the room and seems shocked at the sight. 

  XANDER
    Is she breathing OK?
  GILES
    Still unconscious, though.
  BUFFY
    We've still got work to do.

  Cut to:
  25     INT.     WILLOW'S 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Buffy addresses Willow and Giles.
  BUFFY
    I think it's maybe some kind of scythe. The only thing I know for sure is 
    it made Caleb back off in a hurry.

  WILLOW
    (giggles) So it's true. Scythe matters. (pushes Giles playfully) 
  GILES
    And, ignoring that, I'd just like to point out this is really quite ingenious. 
    (plays with the weapon)
  BUFFY
    Kills strong bodies 3 ways.

  WILLOW
    And you say you sense something when you hold it?
  BUFFY
    Not much, but it's strong. And I knew it belonged to me. I just knew it.
  GILES
    (inspecting the weapon) In addition to being ancient, it's clearly mystical.

  BUFFY
    Yeah, I figured that one out when I King Arthured it out of the stone.
  WILLOW
    So maybe it's like some kind of traditional slayer weapon.
  GILES
    I can't imagine how something like this could exist without my having heard 
    of it.

  BUFFY
    Well, the good guys are not traditionally known for their communication skills.
  GILES
    Right. Um... (sits on the bed) any chance that it might be something other 
    than a tool for killing things?
  BUFFY
    The First's guys clearly wanted it out of that stone. It's not just a tool. 
    It's important. We need to find out whatever we can. Who made it, when, why? 
    Does it have a name? (shrugs) I don't know, a credit report? Just find out 
    fast.

  GILES
    We'll start work immediately.
  WILLOW
    Yeah, don't worry, Buff. We'll find out everything there is to know. (opens 
    her laptop)
  BUFFY
    Good, because right now, that thing's all we've got going for us.

  Cut to:
  26     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Andrew rips apart a bed sheet as he and Anya attend to the wounded.
  ANDREW
    I liked the real bandages better. These bed sheets are awfully festive. Ecch!

  ANYA
    (bandaging a potential's shoulder) Yeah. They're gonna look like mortally 
    wounded Easter baskets.
  WOUNDED POTENTIAL
    (groggily, alarmed at Anya's words) What?
  ANYA
    Aw. (shrugs, swigs from a bottle)

  ANDREW
    H-hey! We're supposed to use that to sterilize wounds. Mr. Giles said. 
  ANYA
    Come on, what does it really matter? (hands bottle to Andrew)
  ANDREW
    Hmm. Good point. (takes a swig from the bottle)

  ANYA
    Giles knows his single malt antiseptics.
  ANDREW
    Blech. (shakes his head) Everything's horrible.
  ANYA
    Yup. Many of these girls will die. Slaughterhouse is what it is.

  WOUNDED POTENTIAL
    (alarmed at what she hears) What?
  ANYA
    (tenderly) Oh...trying to talk will just kill you sooner.
  ANDREW
    We need supplies, and not just bandages and junk. These—these girls need 
    stitches and painkillers.

  ANYA
    Yeah, well, I could use a cookie, but I'm not making reckless wishes.
  ANDREW
    No, no. We can do it. The hospital. It's gotta be all abandoned like the grocery 
    store. Supplies just lying around for the taking. (Anya shrugs, Andrew stands) 
    I'm going in. (takes a swig)
  ANYA
    (stands) You are?

  ANDREW
    And you're coming with me.
  ANYA
    I am?
  ANDREW
    Well, I think you should drive 'cause that scotch made me a little dizzy.

  ANYA
    (smiles) OK. I'll get Kennedy to watch the girls. She's tough. Imminent death 
    won't bother her.
  WOUNDED POTENTIAL
    (sits up, alarmed) What?
  Cut to:
  27     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    KITCHEN AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY

    Buffy and Xander are having a private chat in the kitchen.
  BUFFY
    You got it?
  XANDER
    Wait. I'm not to the "got it" place yet. I'm still in the neighborhood 
    of "you've gotta be kidding".

  BUFFY
    (sighs) You know it's for the good.
  XANDER
    I don't. Buffy, do you get that? If I do this, that's it for me for this fight. 
    I feel like you're putting me out to pasture.
  BUFFY
    Of course I'm not putting you out to pasture. (shakes her head) What does 
    that even mean?

  XANDER
    Well, you know, it's like, uh... when a cow gets old and loses an eye, or 
    its ability to be milked, the farmer takes it and puts it in a different pasture 
    so it won't have to... fight...with the priests. (chuckles) Look, I don't 
    need you to protect me.
  BUFFY
    I'm not.
  XANDER
    I got hurt, but I'm not done. I can still fight.

  BUFFY
    I know. That's why I need you to do this. Xander, I need someone that I can 
    count on no matter what happens.
  XANDER
    (shakes his head) I just always thought that I would... I would be there with 
    you... you know, for the end.
  BUFFY
    (indignant) Hey.

  XANDER
    (quickly) Well, not that this is the end.
  BUFFY
    Thanks a lot.
  XANDER
    No, no, no. By the end, I meant, uh... a heroic, uplifting way. See, I'm still 
    optimistic. You're just thrown off a little by this gritty-looking eye patch.

  BUFFY
    (smiles) I know what you meant.
  XANDER
    I should be at your side. That's all I'm saying.
  BUFFY
    You will be. You're my strength, Xander. You're the reason I made it this 
    far. I trust you with my life. That's why I need you to do this for me.

  XANDER
    (getting a little misty, sentimental) OK.
  BUFFY
    (breaks the mood jokingly) Also, you can't shoot a bow and arrow anymore, 
    and every time you pick up a sword, I worry that you're gonna break one of 
    our good lamps.
  XANDER
    Hey—

  BUFFY
    Don't look at me. You're the one who said I'm gonna die. (walks toward the 
    door)
  XANDER
    (follows) I never said you were gonna die. I—I implied that you were 
    gonna die. It's totally different.
  BUFFY
    Yeah, OK. Sure.

  XANDER
    Besides, if you die, I'll just bring you back to life. (shrugs) That's what 
    I do.

  28     INT.     WILLOW'S 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DUSK
    Buffy's weapon is leaning against the bed. Willow and Giles are talking in 
    Willow's room as Willow researches on her laptop and Giles flips through books.

  WILLOW
    OK, before the vineyard was just, you know, a vineyard, it was a monastery. 
    Could've been put there then. Some creepy monks messing with powers they don't 
    understand.
  GILES
    No, it's older than that. It's pre-Christian. (scratches his head)
  WILLOW
    OK. Well, I found reference to stories the monks used to tell about something 
    older. Uh, like, some kind of pagan temple.

  GILES
    Native American?
  WILLOW
    No. I don't know. Ugh. OK, maybe we're just going about this the wrong way. 
    (her laptop screen shows a site entitled "History of the Axe") Maybe 
    we should research the weapon itself. Like...look. Maybe it's the Axe of Dekeron, 
    said to have been forged in hell itself. Lost since the Children's Crusade, 
    where it was said to have killed— (sits back, makes a face) Oh. Children. 
    I hope that's not it.
  GILES

    Well, I have reference to the Sword of Moskva, the, uh...Reaper of the Tigris—how 
    are we supposed to narrow this down? The illustrations are never clear enough. 
    (stands, leans on the window) Oh, damn. We're running out of time. We really 
    haven't got anything useful. (Willow walks to the weapon and picks it up) 
    Do you sense any of the power that Buffy spoke about?
  WILLOW
    Gotta say no. Must be a slayer thing.
  GILES
    (walks over to Willow and sits on the edge of the bed) Tapping into magicks 
    might help with that.
  WILLOW

    Maybe. But, I mean, if Caleb is scared of this thing, it must be pretty dangerous. 
    And tapping into that... (puts the weapon down carefully) 
  GILES
    Willow, you could do it without endangering yourself.
  WILLOW
    (apprehensive) If I tried something big, I'd change. And then it's all black 
    hair and veins and lightning bolts. I can hardly do a locator spell without 
    getting dark roots.
  GILES

    (softly) And if it was necessary?
  WILLOW
    Honestly? I don't know. (goes back to her computer) 
  GILES
    (sighs) All right. Do what you can. That's all any of us can do.
  WILLOW

    I guess so. Ugh. Man, none of these sound right. (scrolls down) I mean, look. 
    Here's one that's just "m" question mark. What the heck is that?
  GILES
    (stands) Let me see. (walks to look at the screen) It's not a question mark. 
    It's the international phonetics alphabet symbol for glottal stop.
  WILLOW
    A whoey?

  GILES
    It's sort of a gulping noise. I'm...remembering something here. Um... Ah. 
    Hieroglyphs. Hieroglyphs stand for sets of consonants, as you know.
  WILLOW
    Yes, absolutely.
  GILES
    (paces) "M" plus glottal stop is represented by a picture that's 
    commonly thought to symbolize a sickle or a scythe. It's in thousands of carvings. 
    In Egypt, throughout the ancient world. 

  WILLOW
    Carvings like you'd have on a pagan temple?
  GILES
    Go back. See what else we can find out about this temple. (picks up the weapon) 
    The scythe is a symbol of death. Let's see where these pagans buried their 
    dead.

    OF BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

    Xander and Dawn are rifling through Xander's car.
  DAWN
    Xander, my crossbow is not out here. I told you, I don't leave crossbows around 
    all willy-nilly. (pauses guiltily) Not since that time with Miss Kitty Fantastico.
  XANDER
    Hey, did you know I have to take a driving test every year now?
  DAWN

    Because you're old?
  XANDER
    No, because of my eye. It's a whole state law. They don't trust my depth perception 
    anymore.
  DAWN
    That sucks.
  XANDER

    (stands) And you know what's even worse? All the stupid "it's all fun 
    and games until someone loses an eye" jokes. "Hey, Xander, so no 
    more fun and games, huh?"
  DAWN
    (rolls her eyes, sighs) Giles was just having fun with you.
  XANDER
    That's not the point. It's an obvious joke. It'd be like someone calling me 
    a cyclops.

  DAWN
    Oh. (giggles, then stops, clears throat) OK, so not that funny.
  XANDER
    I mean, uh... give me some "eye of the beholder" jokes. You know? 
    Or, uh... some "eye for an eye" jokes. Or maybe even a post-modern 
    "I, Claudius" joke, you know? It's about standards, Dawnie.

  DAWN
    I know. (stands)
  XANDER
    [Sighs] Just, uh, be creative. 
  DAWN
    Look, everyone's still kind of on guard around you. But before you know it— 
    (Xander puts a cloth over her face, Dawn screams) Aah! Aah!

  Xander pushes Dawn into the car and gets into the driver's seat before 
    driving away.

    CELLAR AT THE SHADOW VALLEY VINEYARDS - NIGHT
    Enraged, Caleb throws a barrel across the room. It splits open and gushes 
    red wine out onto the floor. 
  BUFFY/FIRST

    Not that I care personally, but you are wasting a lot of robust, full-bodied 
    merlot.
  CALEB
    Why did you let her go? You know I can take her in a fight.
  BUFFY/FIRST
    We'll get her. Calm down.
  CALEB

    I'm calm. You should see me when I get angry.
  BUFFY/FIRST
    She's powerful right now. And you're weak.
  CALEB
    You know, all of a sudden, I'm getting less calm.
  BUFFY/FIRST

    Face it. Your strength is waning. It has been quite some time since we've... 
    (looks at him seductively) merged.
  CALEB
    Maybe you're right. OK, let's do it. (sniffs)
  BUFFY/FIRST
    Boy, you sure know how to romance a girl. No flowers, no dinner, no tour of 
    the rectory. Just, "OK, I'm ready. Let's do it." Help me. My knees 
    are weak. (rolls her eyes)

  CALEB
    Watch what you say now. You're starting to sound like her. This is a sacred 
    experience for me.
  BUFFY/FIRST
    And for me as well. Look, when this is all over, and our armies spring forth, 
    and our will sweeps the world, I will be able to enter every man, woman, and 
    child on this Earth, just as I enter you.
  CALEB
    Are you trying to make me jealous?

  BUFFY/FIRST
    I'm trying to make you a God.
  Buffy/First and Caleb are standing across from each other, facing each 
    other, each holding out his hands and leaning his head back. The First changes 
    form into the demonic apparition—huge, with two horns on its head and 
    glowy red eyes (seen before when it entered Willow in Episode 7x10 "Bring 
    On The Night"). The First lunges toward Caleb, glowing and growling.
  CALEB
    I am thy humble servant. 

  The First's energy contracts into a beach-ball sized glowing light and 
    enters Caleb, causing him to wobble a little. He rolls back his head and falls 
    to the ground; when he sits up again, his eyes are black and his voice is 
    creepy and deeper.
  CALEB
    And I am ready to serve thee.
  Fade to black.

  31     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

    Faith is lying in bed holding the scythe in front of her. Buffy's standing 
    beside the bed.
  BUFFY (O.S.)
    You feel it too, don't you?
  FAITH
    Damn. And damn, that's something.
  BUFFY

    I know.
  FAITH
    It's old. It's strong, and it feels like... like it's mine. (places it on 
    the bed beside her) I guess that means it's yours.
  BUFFY
    It belongs to the slayer. (picks up the scythe)
  FAITH

    Slayer in charge, which, I'm guessing, is you.
  BUFFY
    (sits on the edge of the bed) I honestly don't know. Does it matter?
  FAITH
    It never mattered to me. Somebody has to lead. Let's vote for Chao-Ahn. It's 
    harder to lead people into a deathtrap if you don't speak English.
  BUFFY

    It wasn't your fault. 
  FAITH
    (looks away) I'm really not looking for forgiveness.
  BUFFY
    You're not?
  FAITH

    What do you want me to say? I blew it.
  BUFFY
    You didn't blow it.
  FAITH
    Tell that to—
  BUFFY

    People die. You lead them into battle, they're gonna die. It doesn't matter 
    how ready you are or how smart you are. War is about death. Needless, stupid 
    death.
  FAITH
    So, here's the laugh riot. My whole life I've been a loner. 
  BUFFY
    That's the funny part? Did I miss something?
  FAITH

    I'm trying to—
  BUFFY
    Sorry. Sorry. Go.
  FAITH
    No ties, no buddies, no relationships that lasted longer than... well, Robin 
    lasted pretty long. (grins) Boy's got stamina.
  BUFFY

    Principal Wood? And you? And in my— (stands, paces) 
  FAITH
    Don't tell me you two got wriggly.
  BUFFY
    No. No. No, no. We're just good friends. Or mortal enemies, depending on which 
    day of the—

    was that the funny part?
  FAITH
    OK. The point. Me, by myself all the time. I'm looking at you, everything 
    you have, and, I don't know, jealous. Then there I am. Everybody's looking 
    to me, trusting me to lead them, and I've never felt so alone in my entire 
    life.
  BUFFY
    Yeah. (swallows, looks down)
  FAITH

    And that's you every day, isn't it?
  BUFFY
    I love my friends. I'm very grateful for them. But that's the price. Being 
    a slayer.
  FAITH
    There's only supposed to be one. Maybe that's why you and I can never get 
    along. We're not supposed to exist together.
  BUFFY

    Also, you went evil and were killing people.
  FAITH
    Good point. Also a factor. (nods)
  BUFFY
    But you're right. I mean, I... I guess everyone's alone. But being a slayer? 
    There's a burden we can't share.
  FAITH

    And no one else can feel it. (beat) Thank God we're hot chicks with superpowers.
  BUFFY
    Takes the edge off.
  FAITH
    Comforting.
  BUFFY

    Mm-hmm.

    Honey, you're home.
  BUFFY
    Yeah.
  SPIKE
    (sighs) And you did it. Fulfilled your mission. Found the Holy Grail. Or the 
    Holy Hand Grenade, or whatever the hell that is.
  BUFFY

    Right now we're going with scythe. You like?
  SPIKE
    Well, pointy and wooden is not exactly the look I wanna know better, but it 
    does have flair. Can see why a girl would ditch a fella for one of these.

  SPIKE
    It doesn't matter. You're back in the bosom. All's forgiven. And, uh, (stands 
    in front of Buffy, looking at her) last night...was just a glitch. A bit of 
    cold comfort from the cellar dweller. Let's don't make a thing out of it. 
    (breathes nervously)
  BUFFY

    Great. I have work to do.
  SPIKE
    Oh, yeah. Another solo mission, of course.
  BUFFY
    Yeah, it is.
  SPIKE

    That's fine. You don't have to get shirty about it.
  BUFFY
    I'm not shirty. And what is shirty? That's not even a word.
  SPIKE
    All right. All right. Big secret mission. It's fine.
  BUFFY

    It's not a secret. Well, I mean, it is, but that's the point of the mission. 
    Find out the secret. This thing was forged by— I don't even know. I mean, 
    something about... a tomb on unconsecrated ground. That's what I have to do. 
    I need to find out what this is and why I have it.
  SPIKE
    And that's the thing the preacher man was so anxious to keep out of your mitts?
  BUFFY
    That it is.

  SPIKE
    Well, maybe I'll swing by the vineyard when you go, make sure he's sitting 
    tight.
  BUFFY
    Great.
  SPIKE
    OK. (turns to leave)

  BUFFY
    (walks after him) You're a dope.
  SPIKE
    I'm a what?
  BUFFY
    You're a dope. And a bonehead. And you're shirty.

  SPIKE
    Have you gone completely carrot-top?
  BUFFY
    Do you see this? (holds up the scythe) This may actually help me fight my 
    war. This might be the key to everything. And the reason I'm holding it is 
    because of you. Because of the strength that you gave me last night. Look, 
    I am tired of defensiveness and weird, mixed signals. You know, I have Faith 
    for that. Let's just get to the truth here, OK? I don't know how you felt 
    about last night, but I will not—
  SPIKE
    (breathes in, looks away) Terrified.

  BUFFY
    Of what?
  SPIKE
    (lets out a slow sigh) Last night was... (looks up) God, I'm such a jerk. 
    I can't do this.
  BUFFY
    Spike...

  SPIKE
    It was the best night of my life. If you poke fun at me, you bloody well better 
    use that, 'cause I couldn't bear it. It may not mean that much to you, but—
  BUFFY
    I just told you it did.
  SPIKE
    (sighs) Yeah...I hear you say it, but... I've lived for soddin' ever, Buffy. 
    I've done everything. Done things with you I can't spell, but... I've never... 
    been close... to anyone. Least of all, you. 'Til last night. All I did was... 
    (smiles) hold you, watch you sleep. And it was the best night of my life. 
    So, yeah... I'm... terrified.

  BUFFY
    You don't have to be.
  SPIKE
    (looks at her) Were you there with me?
  BUFFY
    (looks straight at him) I was.

  SPIKE
    What does that mean?
  BUFFY
    I don't know. Does it have to mean something?
  SPIKE
    No. (looks away) Not right now.

  BUFFY
    Maybe when...
  SPIKE
    No. (throws up his hand) Let's just leave it.

    Ooh. This one has oxygen tanks.

    They'd only be useful if something big was attacking, and then we could shove 
    one down their throat and blow 'em up like Roy Scheider did with that shark 
    in Jaws. (Andrew stares at her) What?
  ANDREW
    You are the perfect woman.

  ANYA
    I've often thought so. Wanna rob?
  ANDREW
    Let's rob. (they walks to the shelves and rifle through things) Oh, cool. 
    Gauze and alcohol... tape and, oh, sutures, if we want to get stitchy with 
    it. Oh, and there's a... box of ointment here. I used one of these on a rash 
    once.
  ANYA
    Oh. Show me.

  ANDREW
    Well, it—it's healed up, but it was red and crusty with these little 
    itchy places. 
  ANYA
    Show me the box full of ointments, you little freak. And get cotton packing 
    for the big wounds.
  ANDREW
    It's gonna be bad, isn't it?

  ANYA
    Yeah.
  ANDREW
    (sighs) So how come you're here? I mean, you could just go. Right?
  ANYA
    Yeah. I did once before. 

  ANDREW
    Before what?
  ANYA
    Well...there was this other apocalypse... this one time, and... well, I took 
    off. But this time, I don't...I don't know.
  ANDREW
    (sighs) Well...what's different?

  ANYA
    Well...I guess I was...kinda new to bein' around humans before. But now I've... 
    seen a lot more, gotten to know people... seen what they're capable of, and... 
    (shrugs) I guess I just realized...how amazingly screwed-up they all are. 
    I mean really, really screwed-up in a monumental fashion.
  ANDREW
    Oh. (nods)
  ANYA
    And they have no purpose that unites them, so they just drift around, blundering 
    through life until they die...which they...they know is coming, yet every 
    single one of them is surprised when it happens to them. They're incapable 
    of thinking about what they want beyond the moment. They kill each other, 
    which is clearly insane. And yet, here's the thing. When it's something that 
    really matters, they fight. I mean, they're lame morons for fighting, but 
    they do. They never... never quit. So I guess I will keep fighting, too.

  ANDREW
    (sighs) That was kind of beautiful. (Anya nods) You...you love humans.
  ANYA
    (indignant) I do not.
  ANDREW
    Yes, you do. You loooove them 

  ANYA
    Stop it! I don't love them! And I'll kill you if you tell anybody.
  ANDREW
    I won't tell anybody. Won't get a chance to, anyway.
  ANYA
    I don't know. You might survive.

  ANDREW
    No, you might survive. You know how to handle a weapon, and you've been in 
    this world for, like, a thousand years. I'm not so... (sighs) I don't think 
    I'll be OK. I'm cool with it. I think I'd like to...finish out as one of those... 
    lame humans tryin' to do what's right. (smiles)

    Buffy walks down into the tomb. It's lit inside, although dimly, by torches, 
    giving it an orange hue. Buffy looks around cautiously. A woman's voice comes 
    from behind a drape. 
  WOMAN (O.S.)
    I'd forgotten. I'd forgotten how young you would be. 
  The woman opens the drape, and Buffy sees a very old woman with long white 
    hair standing before her.

  WOMAN
    Comes from the waiting. Mind plays tricks. I see you've found our weapon.
  BUFFY
    Who are you?
  WOMAN
    One of many. Well...time was. Now I'm alone in the world.

  BUFFY
    So what are you? Some kind of ghost?
  WOMAN
    (chuckles softly, shakes her head) Nope. I'm as real as you are. Just...well... 
    let me put it this way— I look good for my age. I've been waiting. (holds 
    out her hands; Buffy hands over the scythe) You pulled it out of the rock. 
    I was one of those who put it in there.
  BUFFY

    What is it?
  WOMAN
    (admires the scythe) A weapon. A scythe. Forged in secrecy for one like you 
    who— I'm sorry. What's your name?
  BUFFY
    Buffy.

  WOMAN
    No, really. (Buffy shrugs) We forged it in secrecy and kept it hidden from 
    the Shadow Men, who—
  BUFFY
    Yeah. Met those guys. Didn't really care too much for 'em.
  WOMAN
    Ahh, yes. Then you know. And they became the watchers. And the watchers watched 
    the slayers. But we were watching them. 

  BUFFY
    Oh! So you're like... what are you?
  WOMAN
    Guardians. Women who want to help and protect you. We forged this centuries 
    ago, halfway around the world.
  BUFFY
    Hence, the Luxor Casino theme.

  WOMAN
    Forged there, it was put to use right here...to kill the last pure demon that 
    walked upon the Earth. The rest were already driven under. And then there 
    were men here, and then there were monks. And then there was a town, and now 
    there was you. And the scythe remained hidden.
  BUFFY
    I don't understand. How is it possible that we didn't know any of this?
  WOMAN
    We hid, too. We had to until now. We're the last surprise.

  BUFFY
    Does this mean I can win?
  WOMAN
    That is really up to you. This is a powerful weapon. (hands the scythe back 
    to Buffy)
  BUFFY
    Yeah.

  WOMAN
    But you already have weapons.
  BUFFY
    Oh.
  WOMAN
    Use it wisely and perhaps you can beat back the rising dark. One way or another, 
    it can only mean an end is truly near.

  The woman's head cocks slightly to the side, and a cracking noise can 
    be heard. The woman falls to the ground. Buffy looks up and sees Caleb standing 
    there.

    What happened?
  XANDER

    Um, I thought you might say that.

    (sluggish) Actually I meant to say what the hell happened?
  XANDER
    It was chloroform.

    Away. (hands Dawn a letter)
  DAWN
    What's this?
  XANDER
    Just open it.
  Dawn opens the letter and starts reading.

    Dearest Dawn, don't be angry with Xander. He only did what I told him to do. 
    This isn't the place for either of you. Please know that I love you and that 
    everything I do is for you. I promised once to show you this beautiful world, 
    and I'm going to do everything I can to make that happen—
  Without letting Xander see it, Dawn puts a stun gun up to Xander's neck

    as shown when he tries to punch Buffy, but she ducks and he instead punches 
    through a stone pillar. 
  CALEB
    Ha ha ha ha! You're not slipping out of this fight, girl. Can't you see? You 
    can't stop me. I can just keep going back for more. It's like being reborn.
  Buffy swings the scythe at Caleb's head, but he ducks and throws her against

    she falls to the ground again. He kicks her in the head and grabs the scythe, 
    but Buffy kicks it out of his hands and into the air. Buffy grabs the scythe 
    and kicks Caleb to the floor. She goes to stab him with the stake-end of the 
    scythe, but he stops her from plunging it into his chest. Caleb laughs and 
    pushes Buffy away, taking the scythe away from her and throwing it to the 
    ground as he walks toward her. He punches her repeatedly until she falls to 
    the floor.
  CALEB
    You know, I gave you ample warning. Told you not to interfere, but you chose 
    not to heed.

  Buffy charges toward Caleb, but he deflects her and throws her onto a 
    sarcophagus. She kicks him. He picks her up by the lapels and swings her body 
    into a stone pillar so hard that it moves one of the stones out of place. 
    Buffy falls to the ground, and Caleb picks up the scythe.
  CALEB
    I was kind of hoping it'd go this way. (rears back with the scythe as he stares 
    at Buffy)
  MAN (O.S.)
    Hey! (punches Caleb, knocking him down)
  Buffy looks up to see that it's Angel standing there having knocked Caleb 
    down. Angel helps her to her feet.

  ANGEL
    I was never much for preachers.
  BUFFY
    Angel.
  ANGEL
    You look good.

  BUFFY
    You look timely. And also good. (smiles) 
  ANGEL
    Heard maybe you needed a hand. 
  Caleb gets to his feet. Angel starts to go help finish him off, but Buffy 
    stops him.
  ANGEL

    Ah, one of those things you have to finish yourself.
  BUFFY
    Really kinda is.
  Angel backs toward a pillar so he can be out of the way but still see 
    the show. Caleb walks toward Buffy. 
  ANGEL
    (crosses his arms, licks his lips) You are so gonna lose. 

  Buffy and Caleb fight. Caleb takes the scythe away from Buffy and punches 
    her, sending her stumbling across the room. Caleb points the stake-end of 
    the scythe at Buffy and charges toward her, with her back against the wall, 
    but he misses, lodging the scythe in the stone wall. Buffy pulls the scythe 
    out of the wall and kicks Caleb away from her. 
  ANGEL
    God, I missed watching this.
  Buffy swings the scythe at Caleb, slicing his stomach. He stumbles back, 
    laughs heartily, wags his finger at her, and falls to the floor.
  BUFFY
    See? Under control.

  ANGEL
    Well...at least you could tell me you're glad to see me. (walks toward Buffy)
  Buffy drops the scythe to the floor and walks up to Angel, pressing herself 
    against his body and kisses him deeply on the lips. 
  Pan over to show Spike is in the tomb as well, hiding behind the pillar, 
    watching them. Buffy/First is beside him, whispering in his ear.
  BUFFY/FIRST
    That bitch.
