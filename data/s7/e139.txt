  GILES (V.O.)
    Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
  1     EXT.     CEMETARY 
    IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT
    Giles is telling his story to the girls as they patrol. Buffy, Kennedy, Amanda 
    and a new slayer in training are with him. From out of nowhere, someone attacks 
    Giles, knocking him to the ground. It's Spike.
  BUFFY
    (worried) Spike!
  GILES
    Why didn't your chip go off?
  BUFFY
    We were at the Initiative... (looks at Spike)
  SPIKE
    (looks at Buffy) There was a choice.
  BUFFY
    (looks at Giles) Right. Either repair the chip, or to remove it.
  GILES
    You removed the chip?
  BUFFY
    (smiling, trying to look innocent) Yeah.
  Cut to:
  2     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Buffy's sitting at her vanity, putting on large gold hoop earrings. She's 
    wearing a thin v-necked red sweater. Giles walks down the hall toward her 
    room and stops at the doorway.
  BUFFY
    (turns to face Giles) Spike has a soul now. That's what's gonna stop him from 
    hurting people.
  GILES
    Buffy...
  BUFFY
    He can be a good man, Giles. I feel it. 
  Cut to:
  3     EXT.     ALLEY 
    IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT
    Buffy realizes that Principal Wood is also fighting off vampires. Without 
    her help. Principal Wood overpowers one of the vampires and stakes him. Then 
    knocks the last one to the ground, staking him too. He flips the stake in 
    his hand, then returns it to his belt holster as he walks back to Buffy. 
  Cut to:
  4     INT.     ROMANTIC 
    FRENCH RESTAURANT - NIGHT
    Buffy and Principal Wood are sitting across from each other at a small table 
    in a very elegant, romantic restaurant. Principal Wood is talking to the waitress, 
    ordering from the menu.
  BUFFY
    How do you know about slayers?
  ROBIN
    My mother was one. She was killed when I was four. 
   
    FLASHBACK: A very punk Spike is fighting with a young black woman in 
      a New York subway car. He overpowers her, and, straddling her on the floor, 
      he breaks her neck. (from episode 5x07 "Fool For Love")
  
  BUFFY
    (nervously) Um, something got her... a demon—?
  ROBIN
    A vampire. 
  Cut to:
  5     INT.     PRINCIPAL 
    WOOD'S CAR - NIGHT
    Principal Wood is driving the car, with Buffy as passenger and Spike in the 
    back seat. Buffy's very tense and uncomfortable looking, and Spike's crouched 
    down in the corner of the back seat.
  ROBIN
    (Principal Wood watches the rear view mirror suspiciously) So, how do you 
    two know each other?
  BUFFY
    (answering too fast) He works with me. Uh, you know, in the struggle against 
    evil.
  Cut to:
  6     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT
    Buffy and Lissa are fighting when Spike enters the room. Lissa starts whaling 
    on Spike. She kicks Buffy away, knocking her to the ground. She pushes Spike 
    down and starts strangling him, bringing forth Spike's vampire facade. Principal 
    Wood sees Spike's face change.
  ROBIN
    He's a vampire.
  Cut to:
  7     INT.     HALLWAY 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT
    Wearing the duster, Spike walks down the hallway toward the exit. He passes 
    Principal Wood, who's standing in a doorway.
  ROBIN
    Nice coat. Where'd you get it?
  
    FLASHBACK: A very punk Spike takes a leather duster from the woman he 
      just killed, and puts on the coat. (from episode 5x07 "Fool For Love")
  
  SPIKE
    (walks by Wood without looking at him or stopping) New York.
  Wood watches Spike walk away.

    The Start Of Episode
  
  PROLOGUE:
  8     EXT.     PARK 
    IN NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT
    TITLE: New York City, 1977
    It's pouring down rain in the middle of the night somewhere in the city. Two 
    people are fighting in the paved walkway in a park. It's a pretty rough fight. 
    Zoom in on them to show vamped Spike fighting Nikki. Nikki kicks Spike, sending 
    him tumbling. He stands and speaks to her.
  SPIKE
    (exhilarated) Well, all right. Got the moves, don't you? I'm gonna ride you 
    hard before I put you away, luv.
  NIKKI
    You sure about that? You actually look a little wet and limp to me. And I 
    ain't your "luv."
  Nikki kicks Spike and they begin fighting again. Zoom in on a nearby park 
    bench. A little boy watches them from behind the bench, peeking through the 
    slats. Spike and Nikki continue to fight. Spike overpowers Nikki, pushing 
    her to the ground and straddling her, punching her repeatedly in the face. 
    Nikki grabs Spike's arm and kicks him off of her. The little boy is still 
    watching them fight. Nikki punches Spike, but this time, he grabs her arm 
    and twists it around so that he can almost bite her neck. Alarmed, the boy 
    stands, knocking over the trash can beside him. This startles Spike, who turns 
    to see what happened. Nikki seizes the moment, and head-butts Spike, freeing 
    herself from his grip. She then elbows him, punches him, and knocks him down. 
    When he stands, she has a stake ready and throws it at his heart. Spike catches 
    it between his palms only inches in front of his chest. 
  SPIKE
    (grinning) I spent a long time trying to track you down. Don't want the dance 
    to end so soon, do you, Nikki? The music's just starting, isn't it? (tosses 
    the stake back toward her; it lands on the pavement; Spike starts to walk 
    away, but swings around on a lamp post, staring at her) By the way...love 
    the coat. (walks away)
  YOUNG ROBIN
    (from behind the bench) Mamma!
  NIKKI
    (goes up to Robin, squats down to be on eye-level with him) You did a good 
    job, baby boy. You stayed down just like mamma told you.
  YOUNG ROBIN
    Can we go home now?
  NIKKI
    Uh-uh. It's not safe there anymore. How 'bout I leave you over at Crowley's 
    house, and you can play with those spooky doodads that you like.
  YOUNG ROBIN
    No, I wanna stay with you.
  NIKKI
    (looks back over her shoulder, then back at Robin) Yeah, I know you do, baby. 
    But remember, Robin, honey what we talked about. Always got to work the mission. 
    (Robin looks down) Look at me. (Robin looks at Nikki) You know I love you, 
    but I got a job to do. The mission is what matters...right? (Robin nods) That's 
    my boy. Come on.
  Nikki stands and takes Robin's hand. They walk away, but Robin turns around 
    and runs back to the scene of the fight to pick up the stake that Spike dropped. 
     
  NIKKI
    Robin? (turns to look)
  Cut to:
  9     EXT.     ALLEY 
    IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT
    Adult Robin Wood turns to look over his shoulder, stake in hand. He's fighting 
    vampires, as are Buffy and Spike, who are there with him. Spike twirls a pole 
    and stakes his opponent through the heart. Buffy's fighting a vampire, but 
    calls out to Spike.
  BUFFY
    Spike! (nods her head toward Robin)
  Spike looks over at Robin, who's fighting a vampire. The vampire is beating 
    up on Robin, but just as the vampire throws Robin to the ground and stands 
    over him growling, he turns to dust. As the dust settles, Spike can be seen 
    standing behind the vampire with a shovel in his hand. 
  SPIKE
    Little tip, mate. (offers Robin a hand to help him stand) Stake's your friend. 
    Don't be afraid to use it. (starts to walk away, but notices Robin staring 
    at him) What?
  Robin just shakes his head. Zoom in on a stake in Robin's closed fist—he's 
    squeezing it so tight that blood is oozing out between his fingers.
  ROBIN
    (glaring at Spike, mumbling under his breath) Just waiting for my moment.

  Opening Credits.
  ACT I:
  10     INT.     PRINCIPAL'S 
    OFFICE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Robin is peeking out of his window through the Levelor blinds, watching the 
    students in the hallway. His hand is bandaged. Buffy walks up to his door.
  BUFFY
    Situation still normal. (shrugs) Well, or as normal as this school ever sees.
  ROBIN
    (lets go of the blinds) So it appears. (turns)
  BUFFY
    (puts her purse down) Well, no fires, no one's head's going kablooey. And 
    the swing choir and the marching band have gone back to their normal, healthy 
    seething resentment.
  ROBIN
    (smiles) Yeah, it's been pretty quiet around here since you shut down that 
    seal. (walks up to Buffy) You just may have stopped this thing, Buffy.
  BUFFY
    No, it can't be that easy.
  ROBIN
    You call that easy?
  BUFFY
    Hey, any apocalypse I avert without dying? Yeah, those are the easy ones.
  ROBIN
    (looks down) You know, you're, uh...You're something else, Miss Summers. (looks 
    at Buffy) You know, I've been watching you when you're out patrolling, and 
    you, um— You remind me of my, um...
  BUFFY
    Your mother?
  ROBIN
    Yeah. Yeah, what I remember of her, anyway.
  BUFFY
    Got to tell you, not a line every girl likes to hear, but—in this case— 
    (smiles) compliment taken. Maybe you're right. Maybe everything is fine.
  GILES
    (walks up to Buffy) Everything's terrible. Total catastrophe.
  BUFFY
    Giles, what's wrong?
  GILES
    Have you seen the new library? There's nothing but computers. There's not 
    a book to be seen. I—I don't know where to begin, Buffy. I mean, who 
    do we speak to?
  ROBIN
    Uh, that would—that would be me. (offers his hand to Giles) Hi. I'm Robin 
    Wood.
  GILES
    Oh, sorry. (shakes Robin's hand) Rupert Giles. Sorry. Buffy tells me you're 
    something of a freelance demon fighter. (Robin points to his office door, 
    then closes it) Oh, yes, yes. I, um, I'm relieved. We're running dangerously 
    low on allies.
  BUFFY
    So, we didn't stop it, then?
  Robin sits behind his desk, Buffy sits on it.
  GILES
    (leans forward on Robin's desk) Uh, no, the seers at the coven are certain 
    the First is continuing to gather its forces. I'm afraid war is inevitable. 
    (stands) So, we should go before the school board. 
  ROBIN
    (confused) What?
  GILES
    Well, I can have my backup library (Buffy rolls her eyes) sent from home in 
    the mean time. It's not much, but—
  BUFFY
    Giles.
  GILES
    Knowledge comes from crafted bindings and pages, Buffy, not ones and zeros.
  BUFFY
    So, did you bring back any potentials?
  GILES
    Um, no. Actually, m-my, uh, (takes off glasses to clean them) my trip is about 
    something else...regarding Spike.
  BUFFY
    Spike? What about him?
  GILES
    I told you my concerns when you recklessly chose (puts glasses on) to remove 
    the chip from his head. 
  ROBIN
    Wait, sorry, chip?
  GILES
    Uh, it's a long story. 
  BUFFY
    The military put a chip in Spike's head so he couldn't hurt anyone.
  GILES
    And that would be the abridged version.
  BUFFY
    But he wouldn't hurt anyone anymore because he has a soul now.
  GILES
    Unless the First triggers him again.
  ROBIN
    Triggers the chip?
  BUFFY
    No, the trigger's a post-hypnotic thing. The First put it in his head. It 
    was—made him— He was killing again.
  ROBIN
    So, he has a trigger, a soul, and a chip?
  GILES
    Not anymore.
  BUFFY
    (angrily) It was killing him, Giles.
  ROBIN
    The trigger?
  BUFFY
    No, the chip. The trigger's not active anymore.
  ROBIN
    Because the military gave him a soul? (Buffy and Giles glare at Robin, who 
    throws up his hands) Sorry.
  GILES
    We don't know that the trigger is inactive. (walks over to the window) What 
    I brought back may help us to disarm it, to ascertain exactly what it is that 
    causes Spike's behavior.
  BUFFY
    It was that song, Giles. I'm telling you, it was that song that Spike was 
    singing.
  GILES
    He has no memory of it. Is there any part of it that you can remember?
  BUFFY
    It wasn't like it had a catchy hook or anything like "I'm coming up, 
    so you better get this party started." It was boring, old, and English. 
    Just like you—ull. Yule Brenner. (Giles crosses his arms and glares at 
    Buffy) A British Yule Brenner.
  ROBIN
    (to Giles) This thing you brought to keep Spike from killing again... How's 
    it work?
  GILES
    Well, it will require a bit of magic.

    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Xander is fastening shackles around Spike's wrists.
  XANDER
    (mumbling) No, we couldn't have put these chains back up a week ago. Nah, 
    we gotta work on Spike now, of all times.
  SPIKE
    What? 
  XANDER
    (sighs, stands, looks around) Nothing. (walks away) 
  Pan around the room to show everyone's there: Dawn, Buffy, Giles, Robin, 
    Xander. They're all staring at Spike, who's chained to the wall, sitting on 
    his cot.
  SPIKE
    (to Robin) What are you doing here? You came to see the show?
  ROBIN
    I thought you might need support.
  SPIKE
    Uh-huh. Right, let's get this over with. (to Giles) What're you gonna do? 
    Some hypno-beam? A disarming spell?
  GILES
    (walks up to Spike, but keeps his distance) Not exactly. The First has brainwashed 
    you. There's something in your subconscious that it's using to provoke a violent 
    reaction. So... (takes a small box out of his pocket, and takes a small rock 
    out of the box) we have to put this in your brain.
  SPIKE
    Bugger that! 
  Buffy's eyes grow wide with concern when she sees the stone, but she remains 
    quiet, standing there with her arms crossed.
  GILES
    The Prokaryote stone will move within your mind to reveal the root of the 
    trigger's power. Can unleash ideas, images, memories... Hopefully, once you 
    understand what it is that's...(rolls his eyes) setting you off, you can break 
    its hold on you.
  DAWN
    Hopefully? So, it might not work?
  GILES
    The stone's just a catalyst for the process. The rest is up to Spike.
  SPIKE
    And how do expect to get that hunk of rubble into my cranium?
  GILES
    Willow? (puts the stone in the box and holds it out toward Willow)
  WILLOW
    (walks in carrying a large book) OK. I just hope my pronunciation is in the 
    ballpark. (reading) "Kun'ati belek sup'sion. Bok'vata im kele'beshus. 
    Ek'vota mor'osh boota'ke."
  The stone starts to move like it's alive, no longer solid, but liquid. 
    Giles leans back away from the stone and holds the box up to Spike.
  SPIKE
    (recoiling) Oh, you have got to be joking? What now?
  GILES
    It has to access the cerebral cortex via the optic nerve.
  SPIKE
    Oh, bollocks. With all the rubbish people keep sticking in my head, it's a 
    wonder that there's room for my brain.
  GILES
    (rolls his eyes) I don't think it takes up that much space, do you?
  Giles holds the box up to Spike's face. The liquid stone crawls out of 
    the box onto Spike's cheek, then shimmies up into his eye, sliding under his 
    eyelid. Spike starts to squirm.
  SPIKE
    Ow. Oh, ow!
  BUFFY
    (runs to his side) Spike! Spike, listen to me. 
  SPIKE
    Yeah.
  BUFFY
    Are you all right?
  SPIKE
    How am I supposed to know if this bug-ugly's doing its job—
  An orange light distracts Spike and he looks into a far off place.

  12     INT.     VICTORIAN 
    PARLOR - DAY
    Spike's looking off into another world. A man is standing, reading to an old 
    woman who sits on a chair in front of him needle pointing. The room's decorated 
    with lots of knick-knacks around, the walls are covered with paintings, and 
    there's a cozy fire in the fireplace. Zoom in on the man to show it's Spike 
    when he was alive, when he was William. He's reading from hand-written pages, 
    presenting his poetry.
  WILLIAM
    Yet her smell, it doth linger, painting pictures in my mind.
    Her eyes, balls of honey. Angel's harps her laugh.
    Oh, lark. Grant a sign if crook'd be Cupid's shaft.
    Hark, the lark, her name it hath spake.
    "Cecily" it discharges from twixt its wee beak.
  WOMAN
    (proud) Oh, William....
  WILLIAM
    It's just...scribbling.
  WOMAN
    Nonsense. It's magnificent. I wonder, though. This Cecily of whom you write 
    so often...
  WILLIAM
    (turns) Oh. 
  WOMAN
    Would that be the Underwood's eldest girl?
  WILLIAM
    (shrugs, looks down) Uh, no, uh, no. I do not presume.
  WOMAN
    She's lovely. You shouldn't be alone. You need a woman in your life.
  WILLIAM
    (looks at the woman) I have a woman in my life.
  WOMAN
    But you ne— (giggles) Oh... (giggles)
  WILLIAM
    Well, do not mistake me. (takes off his reading glasses) I still have hopes 
    that one day there will be an addition to this household, but I will always 
    look after you, mother. This, I promise. 
  The woman has a coughing fit, and covers her mouth with a handkerchief. 
    William hands her a glass of water. She puts down the hand holding her handkerchief 
    when she drinks the water held with her other hand, but William can see there's 
    blood on the handkerchief.
  WILLIAM
    Should I send the coach for Doctor Gull?
  WOMAN/MOTHER
    (shakes her head) I'll be all right. It's passed. Just sit with me a while, 
    will you?
  WILLIAM
    Of course.
  William sits on the floor, leaning on her knee as she goes back to her 
    needle pointing and sings to him.
  MOTHER
    (singing) Early one morning, just as the sun was shining, I heard a maid sing 
    in the valley below. 
    "Oh, don't deceive me. Oh, never leave me. How could you use a poor maiden 
    so?"
  William closes his eyes and listens to his mother sing.
  Cut to:
  13     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Spike opens his eyes again, and they turn yellow as he vamps out in a rage. 
    He grabs Buffy's neck as she sits beside him and throws her across the room 
    into the washer and dryer. He stands, growling, and lunges out toward the 
    others standing there, but he's restrained by the chains. Then he turns to 
    the cot, picks it up, and throws it across the room. It knocks Dawn down, 
    and Willow runs to her side.
  WILLOW
    Dawn!
  Xander, Giles, and Robin step back as Spike rages in their direction. 
    Buffy steps forward, but Spike throws his head back and looks like he's having 
    a mild seizure. The stone is coming out of his eye, slithers down his cheek, 
    and falls to the floor, solid again. Spike's back to human face, looking around 
    as Buffy and Giles stare at him, trying to determine if he's still dangerous. 
    Spike pants as he recovers from the event. Robin glares at Spike.
  Fade to black.
  ACT II:
  14     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Spike's squatting down on the floor, still chained to the wall. Buffy, Giles, 
    and Robin are the only ones still down there with him, and they're keeping 
    their distance. 
  SPIKE
    Get these sodding things off me. I'm fine.
  BUFFY
    (arms crossed) Don't you think you should take a little time, calm down?
  SPIKE
    I am calm. (to Giles) This stone of yours is—is out, right? Did its job, 
    so I'm de-triggered, right?
  GILES
    Spike, what do you remember about the song?
  SPIKE
    (nods, looks away) Oh, yeah, the song. It's called, uh, "Early One Morning." 
    Old folk ditty.
  ROBIN
    What's it mean to you?
  SPIKE
    Mean? Nothing. It's just, uh, my mum. It was her favorite. She used to sing 
    it to me... (smirks) when I was a baby.
  GILES
    And...?
  SPIKE
    No "and." That's it. Look, shouldn't you check on Dawnie? I clocked 
    the niblet pretty fierce.
  BUFFY
    She'll be OK. She's tough.

    Willow's cleaning Dawn's bruised forehead. Willow and Dawn are sitting on 
    the couch, Kennedy's sitting on the arm on the couch, just behind Willow, 
    and Rona's standing beside Kennedy. Andrew, Anya and Xander are also in the 
    room.
  DAWN
    Ow!
  WILLOW
    I'm sorry. (the phone rings, Andrew goes to answer it) Doesn't look like anything's 
    broken?
  DAWN
    Did you use some sort of a magic x-ray?
  WILLOW
    No, that's just what people usually say. (Dawn pouts)
  KENNEDY
    So, Spike's trigger's been active this entire time?
  RONA
    How can Buffy take this for granted? I mean, he lives in our house, we train 
    with him.
  ANYA
    Don't waste your time down that road. Spike's got some sort of "Get Out 
    of Jail Free" card that doesn't apply to the rest of us. I mean, he could 
    slaughter a hundred frat boys, and— (everyone looks at Anya disapprovingly; 
    Anya laughs it off) Forgiveness makes us human. blah-dee-blah-blah-blah.
  ANDREW
    (holding the phone) Uh, Willow...call for you from L.A. Somebody named Fred. 
    The guy sounds kind of effeminate.

    Giles is still interrogating Spike as Buffy and Robin look on.
  GILES
    Spike, listen to me. What is it about your mother?
  SPIKE
    I don't know. I got along fine with her. She was a nice lady.
  GILES
    Well there has to be more than that.
  SPIKE
    (screaming) Well, there bloody well isn't!
  Buffy walks toward Spike, but Giles stops her.
  GILES
    What are you doing?
  BUFFY
    I'm going to unchain him.
  GILES
    Buffy, just—
  BUFFY
    (whispering) This is pointless, Giles. He doesn't know anything. Your prophylactic 
    stone didn't work.
  GILES
    (whispering) Because he's not cooperating. This process takes time. He's blocking 
    whatever's flooding his consciousness. And what he does—he's endangering 
    us all.
  ROBIN
    So, the trigger's still working?
  GILES
    Much as ever. (turns away in disgust) 
  Spike fights against his chains. He looks at his hands, and a feminine 
    hand clad in black lace slips into it.

    Ooh, such a pretty house you have, sweet William. It smells of daffodils...and 
    viscera.
  WILLIAM
    Don't get too attached, now. (twirls her) Won't be here for long, luv.
  DRUSILLA
    (sits on the couch) Well then... (pats the seat beside her) should we give 
    it a proper goodbye? (growls seductively)
  WILLIAM
    (walks toward her) You're a saucy one, aren't you? (sits beside her, kissing 
    her passionately, grabs her up in his arms, and flings her across his lap, 
    leaning in to kiss her again) Dru...we'll bring this world to its knees.
  DRUSILLA
    It's ripe and ready, my darling, waiting for us to devour its fruit.
  WILLIAM
    We'll ravage this city together, my pet. Lay waste to all of Europe. The three 
    of us will teach those snobs and elitists with their falderal just what—
  DRUSILLA
    Three?
  WILLIAM
    You, me, and mother. (Drusilla looks away, disappointed) We'll open up their 
    veins and bathe in their blood as they scream our names across— (he notices 
    Dru's expression) What?
  DRUSILLA
    You...you want to bring your mum wif us?
  WILLIAM
    Well, yeah. You'll like her.
  DRUSILLA
    (scoffs) To eat, you mean?
  William's mother comes into the parlor wearing her nightclothes. 
  MOTHER
    William?
  WILLIAM
    (grabs Drusilla's hand, they stand) Uh, mother.
  MOTHER
    Where have you been? I've been beside myself for days.
  WILLIAM
    You needn't have worried, mother. You'll never have to worry about anything 
    again. Something has happened. I've changed.
  MOTHER
    I—I don't— Who's this woman?
  DRUSILLA
    I'm the other that gave birth to your son.
  MOTHER
    I beg your pardon?
  WILLIAM
    It's true, mother. (holds out his hand to Drusilla, she takes his hand and 
    walks forward) Drusilla—she...she has made me what I am. I am no longer 
    bound to this mortal coil. I have become a creature of the night. A vampire.
  MOTHER
    Are you drunk?
  WILLIAM
    (looks down) A little bit. (Mother coughs, he walks forward) Think of it. 
    No more sickness. No more dying. You'll never age another day. Let me do this 
    for you.
  MOTHER
    What are you talking about, a-and why are you acting so strangely?
  WILLIAM
    It's all right, mother. It's only me. (hugs his mother) We'll be together 
    forever. 
  MOTHER
    William...
  WILLIAM
    (vamps out) It only hurts for a moment. (bites his mother's neck)

    Willow walks down the stairs to the basement to talk to Buffy.
  WILLOW
    Buffy? Hey, I, uh, just got a phone call. I'm gonna have to take off for a 
    while. Maybe a day or two?
  BUFFY
    What's wrong?
  WILLOW
    Nothing you need to worry about. I'll give you the full scoop later. Maybe 
    I'll even bring back some good news?
  BUFFY
    Could use a little of that. OK. I guess now is as good a time as we're likely 
    to see for a while. Just hurry back.
  WILLOW
    Will do. (walks upstairs)
  Buffy walks toward Spike.
  GILES
    Think about what you're doing.
  BUFFY
    I have. (unchains Spike, then walks toward the stairs, with Spike following 
    her)
  GILES
    Buffy...
  BUFFY
    (continues walking without stopping) Don't. 
  Buffy and Spike walk upstairs, Giles goes to follow, but Robin stops him.
  ROBIN
    Mr. Giles... You got a moment?
  GILES
    What's on your mind?
  ROBIN
    The same thing that's on yours. (looks up the stairs) We got ourselves a problem.
  GILES
    Spike. (sighs)
  ROBIN
    Yeah, if that trigger's still working, then the First must be waiting for 
    just the right time to use it against us. 
  GILES
    It does seem doubtful the First simply forgot it had such a powerful weapon.
  ROBIN
    Yeah, a while back, it slipped up. It told Andrew it wasn't time yet for Spike. 
    So, whatever the First's ultimate plan is, it's obvious that Spike must play 
    an integral part in that. Something needs to be done.
  GILES
    (shakes his head) Buffy would never allow it. (walks back downstairs to talk 
    with Robin)
  ROBIN
    Buffy would listen to her Watcher, wouldn't she?
  GILES
    I don't think you have much of an idea of the Watcher-Slayer dynamic.
  ROBIN
    As a matter of fact, I was raised by a Watcher.
  GILES
    You were?
  ROBIN
    Bernard Crowley. Took me in when I was a young kid, trained me.
  GILES
    Crowley. I remember the name. New York based watcher. Resigned shortly after 
    his slayer was— (looks at Robin carefully) You're Nikki Wood's son.
  ROBIN
    (nods) Yes.
  GILES
    Spike killed your mother.
  ROBIN
    (looks away) Yes.
  GILES
    (looks down) Does Buffy know this?
  ROBIN
    She knows my mother was a slayer. She...doesn't know about Spike.
  GILES
    (shrugs) And this has nothing to do with personal vengeance?
  ROBIN
    Does it matter? He's an instrument of evil. Now he's gonna prove to be our 
    undoing in this fight, Buffy's undoing, and she will never—never see 
    it coming. Now, I'm talking about what needs to be done... for the greater 
    good, Giles. And you know I'm right.
  GILES
    (sighs) What exactly do you propose?
  ROBIN
    I just need you to keep Buffy away for a few hours.

    Giles and Buffy are walking through the cemetery, talking.
  BUFFY
    I don't know, Giles. Is this really a primo time for a training session?
  GILES
    I'm still your teacher, Buffy. As adept as you are as a slayer, there are 
    always new things to learn. Now, more than ever, it's crucial to maintain 
    focus on your calling.
  BUFFY
    In case you haven't noticed, our plates are kinda full right now. Plus, I'm 
    not really sure how I feel about leaving Spike at Robin's house to watch over 
    him. 
  GILES
    For what its worth everyone at your house seemed....quite relieved at the 
    arrangement. Um, Buffy, uh...while I'm not technically your Watcher anymore, 
    the fact that your life is such chaos only underscores the importance of the 
    lessons I can impart to you.
  BUFFY
    Fine. Impart away.
  GILES
    We're on the verge of war. It's time you looked at the big picture.
  BUFFY
    Hello! All I do is look at the big picture. The other day, I gave an inspirational 
    speech to the telephone repair man.
  GILES
    It takes more than rousing speeches to lead, Buffy. If you're going to be 
    a general, you need to be able to make difficult decisions regardless of cost.
  BUFFY
    Have you seen me with those girls? (paces) I mean, the way I've treated my 
    friends and my family and... Andrew. Believe me, I know how to make hard decisions.
  GILES
    Well, that's what we're here to find out. (a vampire reaches out of his grave)

    Well, I told you. It's my, um, sanctuary. It's the hell mouth, Spike. You

    all right. (goes to his computer)
  SPIKE
    It's a bit much, isn't it? (beat) What's your story, Wood?
  ROBIN
    No story, really. Just trying to do what's right. Make a difference. How 'bout 
    you? What kind of man are you, Spike?
  SPIKE
    Sorry. Not much for self reflection.
  ROBIN
    Yeah, makes sense. (types on the computer, unbuttons his shirt) See, you strike 
    me as the kind of guy who just careens through life, (takes off his shirt, 
    reaches into a drawer near the computer to strap on fighting paraphernalia 
    to his arms) completely oblivious to the damage he's doing to everyone around 
    him.
  SPIKE
    That right?
  ROBIN
    Oh, I know more about you than you think, Spike. See, I've been searching 
    for you for a very, very long time. (looks at Spike) Ever since you killed 
    my mother. 
  SPIKE
    I've killed a lot of people's mothers.
  ROBIN
    (turns back toward the desk to continue putting on his gear) Yeah. You'd remember 
    mine. She was a slayer.
  SPIKE
    So, that's it, innit? Brought me here to kill me?
  ROBIN
    (turns to face Spike) No, I don't wanna kill you, Spike. I wanna kill the 
    monster who took my mother away from me. (clicks the mouse on the computer; 
    a song starts playing; the screen reads "Early One Morning.")
  RECORDED SONG
    Early one morning, just as the sun was rising, I hear a young maid sing in 
    the valley below. "Oh, don't deceive me. Oh, never leave me. How could 
    you use a poor maiden so?"

    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Buffy tucks Dawn into bed, and walks out into the hallway, closing the door 
    behind her. Giles walks up to her as she goes into her doorway.
  GILES
    Buffy...I—I understand your anger. Please believe me, we did what we—
  BUFFY
    (not looking at Giles) He's alive. Spike's alive. Wood failed.
  GILES
    Well, that doesn't change anything. What I told you is still true. You need 
    to learn—
  BUFFY
    (looks at Giles) No, I think you've taught me everything I need to know. (shuts 
    her door)
