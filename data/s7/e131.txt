  TEASER (RECAP SEGMENT):
  GILES (V.O.)
    Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
  1     EXT.     MEXICAN 
    CAR - NIGHT
    Jonathan's driving with Andrew as passenger. The old El Camino car is heavily 
    adorned in super-stereotypical Mexican style: older model car with fringe 
    around the top of the windshield and lots of decorations.
  ANDREW
    You're just scared.
  JONATHAN
    Of course I'm scared. Last time we were here, 33.3bar percent of us were flayed 
    alive. 
  Cut to:
  2     INT.     HALLWAY 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT
    From behind Andrew, Warren walks out from behind some lockers and walks up 
    to Andrew.
  WARREN
    Nice job.
  ANDREW
    Do you have any idea how hard it's been to act this cool?
  WARREN
    Now, that death thing was all part of the master plan. If short round pulls 
    off his end of the bargain, we'll both become gods.
  Cut to:
  3     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT
    Jonathan is packing up his bag, when Andrew comes to him and puts his right 
    hand on Jonathan's shoulder. Jonathan looks up at Andrew, stands, and sees 
    Warren standing behind Andrew. Jonathan's eyes widen as Andres takes his left 
    hand and stabs him in the belly with a dagger. Jonathan looks at Andrew and 
    Warren, hurt. Jonathan collapses onto the metal object that they unearthed. 
    He bleeds profusely, with his blood filling the grooves in the object, as 
    Andrew and Warren stand there and watch. The metal object starts glowing.
  Cut to:
  4     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    HOUSE - NIGHT
    Dawn's sitting on the living room floor in front of the couch, hugging a pillow, 
    amid the destruction from her earlier encounter. Willow comes to talk to her.
  DAWN
    I saw Mom.
  Cut to:
  5     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT SUMMERS HOUSE - NIGHT
    Joyce is standing there, all glowy and robed in white, talking to Dawn, who's 
    still sitting on the floor.
  JOYCE
    Things are coming, Dawn. 
  DAWN
    Why are you—?
  JOYCE
    When it's bad, Buffy won't choose you. 
  Cut to:
  6     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    HOUSE - NIGHT
    Dawn's sitting on the living room floor in front of the couch, hugging a pillow, 
    amid the destruction from her earlier encounter. Willow comes to talk to her.
  WILLOW
    It wasn't her.
  DAWN
    What?
  WILLOW
    It's the Big Bad, Dawn. The one we knew was coming.
  Cut to:
  7     INT.     UPSTAIRS 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Willow and Buffy are talking in the hallway.
  BUFFY
    What the hell happened? 
  WILLOW
    This big evil that's been promising to devour us—well I think it's started 
    chomping. 
  BUFFY
    Oh, God. 
  WILLOW
    Buffy, this thing knows us. It made us think that we were talking to people 
    we knew. 
  Cut to:
  8     INT.     FOYER 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Buffy and Spike talk near the front door. While Spike talks, show shots of 
    foreign girls being killed.
  SPIKE
    I'm just a guy with his ear to the ground, but even I can feel it. Something's 
    coming. I don't know what exactly, but something's brewing. And it's so big, 
    ugly and damned it makes you and me look like little bitty puzzle pieces. 
  
   
    8a     EXT.     CITY 
      STREET IN ISTANBUL, TURKEY - NIGHT
      A dark-haired girl is running through the arched hallway, looking over her 
      shoulder and panting from the exertion of running so fast. She's being chased. 
      Two people in hooded cloaks are chasing her. Two hooded figures hold her 
      down, and a third figure raises an arched, shiny, silver dagger (possibly 
      an Arabian "Jambaya") and thrusts down at her.
    8b     INT.     PARKING 
      GARAGE IN FRANKFURT, GERMANY - NIGHT
      A girl with hot pink hair with black bangs at her forehead, a nose ring, 
      and a metal collar is trying to escape her pursuers. Finally, she thinks 
      she's safe when she goes through a doorway to the outside near a crowd of 
      club patrons, but she is pushed back inside. Robed men close the door behind 
      them and start to fight with her. She is knocked to the ground, lying on 
      her back. Finally, one of the robed people pulls out a Jambaya (curved silver 
      dagger) and stabs her.
  
  Cut to:
  9     EXT.     OUTSIDE 
    AN APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
    Holding the young woman in an embrace, Spike rears back in vampire face and 
    sinks his fangs into her neck. He drinks deeply, but she doesn't struggle 
    much and barely makes a sound.
  Cut to:
  10     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    HOUSE - NIGHT
    Spike is sitting in a chair, wrapped in a blanket while the others talk in 
    an adjacent room. Buffy, Xander, Anya, Willow and Dawn are all there. Spike's 
    listening to them.
  WILLOW
    Buffy, he's been feeding... on human blood. That's gotta do stuff.
  BUFFY
    I think there was something there, talking to him, making him do things. 
  Cut to:
  11     INT.     BASEMENT 
    OF SPIKE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    This is an enormous brick Tudor style home. Spike's walking into the basement, 
    followed by Buffy.
  SPIKE-2
    (singing, sits on stairs) How could you use a poor maid so?
  As Spike-2 sings, Spike is distracted, mesmerized by the song, unable 
    to respond to Buffy, who's trying to get his attention.
  BUFFY
    Spike!
  Spike vamps out and attacks Buffy. As he does so, he flashes back to all 
    the things he's done—killing, burying, and all the rest.
  SPIKE
    (in human face) I remember. 
  Spike's horrified. His face is one of complete shock and disbelief that 
    he could have actually done those things. Buffy walks over to Spike, still 
    carrying the wooden handle. She stands in front of him. He looks at her, knowing 
    his fate, and scoots out of the cubby hole he was hiding in. He's crying.
  SPIKE
    I killed, and I can feel 'em. I can feel every one of them.
  BUFFY
    There's something playing with us. 
  SPIKE
    Why is it doing this to me?
  BUFFY
    I don't know. 
  SPIKE
    Help me.
  BUFFY
    I'll help you.
  Cut to:
  12     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    HOUSE - NIGHT
    Spike is sitting in a chair, wrapped in a blanket while the others talk in 
    an adjacent room. Buffy, Xander, Anya, Willow and Dawn are all there. Spike's 
    listening to them.
  BUFFY
    This thing has been closer to Spike than any of us.
  WILLOW
    And if you want to understand it....
  BUFFY
    I'm gonna have to get close to Spike.
  Cut to:
  13     INT.     FLAT 
    IN ENGLAND - DAY
    Giles enters the flat, looking around. He sees the young woman lying dead 
    on the floor. 
  GILES
    Robson, are you here? Robson!
  Giles gets up and starts looking for Robson, who's found near a chair 
    in the next room. Giles goes to his side.
  GILES
    (takes off his glasses and starts to cry) Dear God, I thought you—
  ROBSON
    (eyes flash open) Gather them. 
  GILES
    What?
  ROBSON
    It's started.
  GILES
    It's all right. I understand. I'll take care of it—
  One of the robed men sneaks up behind Giles wielding a battle-axe. He 
    swings it at Giles.
  Fade to black.
  End Recap.
   
  The Start Of Episode
  Prologue:
  14     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    HOUSE - NIGHT
    The gang's cleaning up the living room from the aftermath of when Joyce visited 
    Dawn in 7x07 "Conversations With Dead People." Xander's working 
    on the large picture window behind the couch, covering the hole with plastic. 
    Anya's replacing the home decor items on the mantle. Willow's sweeping off 
    a table, when Dawn comes to talk to her.
  DAWN
    So the basement was filled with bodies?
  WILLOW
    Apparently.
  DAWN
    And Spike could've sired countless others and buried them around town. And 
    we're waiting for him to do what, exactly? Do something crazy?
  WILLOW
    (sighs) It's not that simple.
  ANYA
    Shouldn't we stab him through the chest? Isn't that what we do when these 
    things happen?
  WILLOW
    Look, Buffy knows what she's doing.
  ANYA
    Well, Xander, you know what we're all talking about. I mean, you've always 
    been part of the "Spike is evil" faction.
  XANDER
    I've got a house to put back together.
  ANYA
    Fine. You guys keep your heads buried in the sand, but I think we should prepare 
    ourselves for the possibility that William the Bloody is back.
  Cut to:
  15     EXT.     SUNNYDALE 
    STREET - NIGHT
    Show someone wearing black boots—someone's walking along the sidewalk. 
    Pan up: long black leather trench coat, blonde spiked hair. It's Andrew, looking 
    tough and menacing. Warren comes up to him and walks beside him.
  WARREN
    All right. (claps) Looking good. How do you feel? 
  ANDREW
    Good.
  WARREN
    Excellent. We've got work to do.
  ANDREW
    I have to do work right now? Can't I just walk around for a while in my coat?
  WARREN
    Don't go soft on me now. We're right in the trench, and the exhaust port's 
    in sight.
  ANDREW
    I thought that was it. I did what you told me. It's not my fault it didn't 
    work. Why do I have to do all the wet works?
  WARREN
    (stops walking) Hey! You know the rules. I can't take corporeal form. Here, 
    feel. (nods) Mm-hmm.
  ANDREW
    (sticks hand through Warren's chest) Cool.
  WARREN
    Pretty bitchin', right? I'm like Obi Wan?
  ANDREW
    Or Patrick Swayze.
  WARREN
    Believe me, I would do this stuff if I could. I can't. I need you. You're 
    my iron fist.
  ANDREW
    (sighs) I just don't think I can kill anybody else. (shrugs)
  Warren morphs into Jonathan.
  JONATHAN
    Oh, will you stop whining about that?
  ANDREW
    I didn't want to kill you. Warren made me. 
  JONATHAN
    Hey, I'm glad he did. (chuckles) This is the best thing that's ever happened 
    to me.
  ANDREW
    (crosses arms) It didn't hurt too much? I-I'm not very good at stabbing. 
  JONATHAN
    You know, it wasn't that bad. It was like a sharp pain, then a burning, then 
    a general queasiness. It's kinda like when I used to get ulcers in high school, 
    only at the end I became one with light and hope. 
  ANDREW
    I can't do it. I can't do it anymore.
  JONATHAN
    Hey, this isn't your fault, OK. It's my fault the ritual didn't work. I screwed 
    up. I'm little—I-I don't have as much blood as other people. And I probably 
    should've told someone I was anemic. Don't worry. We're gonna fix it. You 
    gotta trust us. We know what we're doing. 
  ANDREW
    I can't kill anybody else.
  JONATHAN
    OK, calm down. We can work around that.
  Cut to:
  16     INT.     BUFFY'S ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Buffy's tying Spike's wrists to a chair he's sitting in.
  BUFFY
    (sighs) We're gonna get to the bottom of this. We just can't take any chances.
  SPIKE
    Don't... Make it tighter—the knots'll give. I get free, someone's gonna 
    die. 
  Fade to black.
  ACT I:
  17     INT.     PRINCIPAL 
    WOOD'S OFFICE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Principal Wood's sitting at his desk, interviewing two teenage boys seated 
    in chairs in front of his desk.
  PRINCIPAL WOOD
    Now, guys, look, we can settle this one of two ways. You can repaint the walls, 
    or I can suspend you and report this little incident on your permanent record.
  PUNK #1
    Fine. Do that.
  PRINCIPAL WOOD
    OK, I was bluffing. I hadn't really thought that one through. (leans forward) 
    Listen, this whole permanent record thing is such a myth anyway. Colleges 
    never ask for anything past your SAT scores, and it's not like employers are 
    gonna be calling up to check to see how many days you missed back in high 
    school. So, listen, I-I could suspend you, (stands, walks around desk) but 
    that would mean calling your parents, alerting your teachers, filling out 
    paperwork, and, quite possibly, having to talk to the school board—(sits 
    on desk in front of them) all of which sounds positively exhausting to me. 
    No. No, I think it would be much easier if I just called the police, let them 
    deal with it. (looks in their eyes) Oh, and, in case you're wondering, this 
    is the part where I'm not bluffing.
  PUNK #2
    (looks at the other boy) We'll repaint it. 
  PRINCIPAL WOOD
    Good job. (there's a knock at his door) Excuse me. (opens door) Miss Summers. 
    I'm with students.
  DAWN
    I just wanted to tell you that Buffy won't be coming in today. She's really 
    sick.
  PRINCIPAL WOOD
    Oh, no.
  DAWN
    Yeah, last night she was vomiting, and then this morning she was vomiting 
    some more, and then, just when we thought she was done, she was vomiting again. 
    (laughs)
  PRINCIPAL WOOD
    Yeah, we got that stomach flu going around.
  DAWN
    Her exact words were, "I've got stuff coming out of both ends."
  PRINCIPAL WOOD
    Thank you. That's very helpful.
  DAWN
    (smiles) Sure. No problem. (to kids) Hey, guys. How's it going?
  PUNK #2
    Pretty good.
  PRINCIPAL WOOD
    Um, tell your sister not to worry about it. We'll soldier on without her here. 
    Just, um, tell her to concentrate on getting better. 
  DAWN
    Yeah, she'll be fine. She just needs to get some stuff out of her system. 
  
  Cut to:
  18     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    HOUSE - DAY
    Buffy's talking on the telephone.
  
    18a     INT.     BUFFY'S 
      KITCHEN - DAY
      BUFFY
      (to phone) I need to find him as soon as possible. He's not answering any 
      of his numbers. 
    18b     INT.     WATCHERS 
      COUNCIL HEADQUARTERS, LONDON - DAY
      Mr. Travers is sitting at a desk, talking on the phone. 
      QUENTIN TRAVERS
      (to phone) Miss Summers, the Watcher's Council does not keep track of our 
      lapsed employees. Ever since Mr. Giles pulled up his stake in Sunnydale, 
      we've not made it our business to follow his every move. 
    18a     INT.     BUFFY'S 
      KITCHEN - DAY
      BUFFY
      (to phone) You don't have to get all British and dodgy, Mr. Travers. I know 
      you have ways of finding him.
    18b     INT.     WATCHERS 
      COUNCIL HEADQUARTERS, LONDON - DAY
      Pan out to show Mr. Travers is sitting at a long conference table, surrounded 
      by members of the Watcher's Council.
      QUENTIN TRAVERS
      (to phone) Well, I suppose if you feel the matter's urgent, we can look 
      into it.
    18a     INT.     BUFFY'S 
      KITCHEN - DAY
      BUFFY
      (to phone) I'd appreciate it. Thank you.
    18b     INT.     WATCHERS 
      COUNCIL HEADQUARTERS, LONDON - DAY
      QUENTIN TRAVERS
      (to phone) Not at all. Good day. (hangs up, sighs, addresses others at the 
      table) The girl knows nothing. (stands, walks) And we need to find Rupert 
      Giles. (stands in front of world map) As soon as possible.
  
  Cut to:
  19     INT.     BUFFY'S ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Spike's still tied to the chair. He's shivering and gasping. Buffy's there, 
    and sits on the bed near him.
  BUFFY
    Can I do something?
  SPIKE
    I think you should probably go—
  BUFFY
    (stands, turns to get something for him) Here.
  As her back is turned, Spike's eyes roll back and he vamps out. When she 
    turns back to Spike, he's changed into vampire face and is struggling against 
    his restraints. 
  Cut to:
  20     INT.     UPSTAIRS 
    HALLWAY AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Buffy's talking to Willow. They're standing outside the closed door to the 
    room, where Spike's tied up.
  BUFFY
    He's been feasting on humans for weeks. He's having some pretty bad withdrawls. 
    I think we need to get him some blood.
  WILLOW
    (excited) Do you want me to kill Anya?
  BUFFY
    (matter-of-factly) No, we should probably try to wean him off humans. He'll 
    have to make do with animal blood.
  WILLOW
    I'll go get some.
  BUFFY
    You don't mind?
  WILLOW
    No, I have to get out of the house. Xander's installing the new windows, and 
    he keeps giving lectures on proper tool maintenance. Tool talk—not my 
    thing. 
  BUFFY
    Thank you.
  WILLOW
    How're you doing in there?
  BUFFY
    He's in pretty bad shape, past the point where he can tell me anything.
  WILLOW
    I wasn't asking about him.
  BUFFY
    I'll be OK. 
  Cut to:
  21     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Andrew's standing with a hunting knife in his hand, holding it forward, looking 
    down. Off screen, Warren's talking to him.
  WARREN
    (off screen)She won't feel a thing. Just do it. Fast. (on screen) Cut her 
    deep. Cut her quick. It'll be over before she knows what hit her. 
  ANDREW
    What if she squeals?
  WARREN
    Uh, better go for her throat first. 
  Cut to what they're looking at and talking about: a pink piglet is standing 
    on the floor in front of them. Pig oinks.
  ANDREW
    Babe 2: Pig in the City was really underrated. 
  WARREN
    Don't think about Babe.
  ANDREW
    Right.
  WARREN
    You're Conan. You're the destroyer. It's you against nature. You're the hunter, 
    you're primal, you live off the land. You're Andrew. Everyone knows you. You 
    play by your own rules. It's kill or be killed.
  ANDREW
    That'll do, pig! (screams and lunges at the pig, it runs away)
  WARREN
    No—you gotta—you gotta corner it. (Andrew stands and lunges for 
    the pig again and misses) Stay between it and the hall, or it— (the pig 
    runs away down the hall, he watches, then sternly) That's the worst attempted 
    pig slaughtering I've ever seen.
  ANDREW
    (on the floor, breathing heavily) I'm not very good at stabbing. Isn't there 
    some other way we could get blood?
  Cut to:
  22     INT.     BUTCHER'S 
    SHOP - DAY
    The butcher calls for the next person in line, and it's Andrew who goes nervously 
    to the counter.
  BUTCHER
    Number 87.
  ANDREW
    (puts his ticket on the counter, clerk takes out a pencil and paper) I'd like 
    12 pork chops, 2 pounds of sausage, 8 quarts of pigs blood, 3 steaks, um, 
    halibut, and, uh, some toothpaste—
  BUTCHER
    (stops writing and stares) This is a butcher's shop, Neo. We don't sell toothpaste. 
  
  ANDREW
    Um, OK—just the other stuff then.
  BUTCHER
    You got it.
  ANDREW
    (whispers to another customer) Hi. (walks to back of store) Ooh, steak sauce. 
  
  Cut to:
  23     INT.     BUTCHER'S 
    SHOP - DAY
    Andrew pays for his order, then starts walking out the door with his arms 
    full of the brown paper bagged groceries. He runs into Willow, who's rushing 
    into the shop, spilling his bag and all its contents on the floor. Willow 
    and Andrew, who recognize each other, stare at one another.
  BUTCHER (O.S.)
    Number 88.
  Fade to black.
  ACT II:
  24     INT.     BUTCHER'S 
    SHOP - DAY
    Andrew runs out of the shop, down the alley beside it, and Willow follows 
    him. 
  WILLOW
    (chasing him) Wait a minute!
  ANDREW
    (stops and turns to face her) Don't kill me!
  WILLOW
    I'm not gonna kill you.
  ANDREW
    Don't torture me and send me to an eternal pain dimension.
  WILLOW
    I'm not gonna. 
  ANDREW
    Warren killed Tara. I didn't do it. And he was aiming for Buffy anyway.
  WILLOW
    (glares) Not making it better.
  ANDREW
    And you got your revenge. You killed my best friend. We're even.
  WILLOW
    Even? You think I get satisfaction from what I did?
  ANDREW
    Maybe not, but let me keep my skin, OK? I'm not bad. I'm not bad anymore. 
    I'm good. I do good things now.
  WILLOW
    Then, why do you need lots and lots of blood?
  ANDREW
    I am bad. I'm bad, I'm evil, but I'm protected by powerful forces. (awkwardly) 
    Forces you can't even begin to imagine, little girl. If you harm me, you shall 
    know the wrath of he that is darkness and terror. Your blood will boil, and 
    you will know true suffering. Stand down, she-Witch. Your defeat is at hand—
  WILLOW
    (pushes him against the brick wall) Shut your mouth. I am a she-witch, a very 
    powerful she-witch, or witch, as is more accurate. I'm not to be trifled with—
  ANDREW
    But I—
  WILLOW
    I'm talking. Don't interrupt me, insignificant man. I am Willow. I am death. 
    If you dare defy me, I will call down my fury, exact fresh vengeance, and 
    make your worst fears come true. OK?
  Cut to:
  25     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    HOUSE - DAY
    Willow drags Andrew home with her. They come in through the front door, with 
    Andrew carrying the groceries from the butcher's shop. Xander, Dawn, and Anya 
    are in the living room. Xander's finishing installing the new window.
  WILLOW
    Look who I found. 
  XANDER
    (looks over) Oh, this can't be good.
  WILLOW
    Guess who was buying mass amounts of blood at the butcher's shop.
  ANDREW
    (to Willow) Hey, your hair's not even black anymore.
  XANDER
    (to Andrew) What're you doing back in town? (walks forward)
  ANDREW
    You'll get nothing out of me, carpenter.
  XANDER
    (taps scrap wood in his hand threateningly) We'll see about that.
  Cut to:
  26     INT.     DAWN'S 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Xander pushes Andrew into a chair and ties his wrists to it, in a similar 
    fashion to Spike's restraints. Anya's standing in front of Andrew, going through 
    his leather trench coat.
  ANDREW
    Careful with my coat. It's expensive.
  ANYA
    Is it new? (throws it on the floor, and steps on it with her shoes)
  ANDREW
    (to Anya) Hey. (to Xander, who tightened a restraint) Ow!
  XANDER
    Now, we can do this the hard way, if you want. (ties up other arm) But believe 
    me if I tell you, this will go much easier if you just tell us what you know. 
    (tightens restraint)
  ANDREW
    Ow. You're barking up the wrong asparagus, man. I don't know anything.
  XANDER
    (pulls up a chair beside Andrew, sits on the chair backwards) Here's the thing. 
    I don't believe you.
  ANDREW
    I haven't done anything wrong.
  XANDER
    Well, then, you won't mind if we ask you a few questions. (Anya's glaring 
    at Andrew)
  ANDREW
    (nervously) Yeah, OK.
  XANDER
    Why were you buying blood at the butcher shop?
  ANDREW
    (rapidly, as if rehearsed) I fell in love with a beautiful vampire girl down 
    in Me-hi-co. Now we're trying to make a go of it on the straight and narrow, 
    and put our lives back together here in Sunnydale.
  ANYA
    (angrily, arms crossed) You think this is a game, junior? People are dying. 
    (grabs Andrew's lapel) Friends lives are in danger.
  XANDER
    (stands) Hey, Anya.
  ANYA
    Now you want to waste time on deceptions? Not on my watch! (backhands him 
    across the face)
  XANDER
    (grabs her forearms) Hey, Anya! Can I talk to you outside for a second?

    Xander and Anya come out of Dawn's room, where they were interrogating Andrew. 
    They look mad. Once they shut the door, Xander turns to face Anya, who's leaning 
    against the door, smiling.
  ANYA
    (giggles, puts her palms to her cheeks) Did you see that? (walks forward) 
    I actually made him cry.
  XANDER
    You were perfect. I was worried I overdid it with the whole "easy way, 
    hard way" thing.
  ANYA
    No, you were great! And I wasn't sure if I should slap him, but then he made 
    me want to slap him, so I thought, OK, slap him!
  XANDER
    He'll be singing in no time. 
  ANYA
    So, what do we do now?
  XANDER
    Now, we let him stew in his own juices for a bit, then we give him the hard 
    brace. 
  ANYA
    Right. (Buffy comes out of her room, which is adjacent to Dawn's) What's the 
    status with your guy?
  BUFFY
    He's not talking yet. We'll get there. (sits on hall window sill) How's your 
    guy?
  ANYA
    The weasel wants to sing. He just needs a tune. 
  XANDER
    He's primed. I'll be pumping him in no time. (Buffy and Anya stare at him) 
    He'll give us information soon.

  BUFFY
    Better? (Spike nods) Good. (Buffy sits on edge of bed)
  SPIKE
    I don't remember anything.
  BUFFY
    Well, you were having pretty bad withdrawal.
  SPIKE
    No, not that. I don't remember... what I did. (sighs) 
  BUFFY
    Nothing?
  SPIKE
    It's all flashes here and there. It's like I'm watching someone else...do 
    it, kill people. I've been losing time for a while now, waking up in strange 
    places.
  BUFFY
    When did your chip stop working?
  SPIKE
    I wasn't aware that it had, you know. Not 'til now.
  BUFFY
    And the losing time? How long has that been going on?
  SPIKE
    Oh, things have been wonky since I got back, ever since—
  BUFFY
    You got your soul.
  SPIKE
    (chuckles) Figured that's what it was like, it'd been so long since I had 
    one.
  BUFFY
    How did you do it? How'd you get your soul back?
  SPIKE
    Saw a man about a girl. (sighs) I went to seek a legend out. Traveled to the 
    other side of the world, made a deal with a demon.
  BUFFY
    Just like that?
  SPIKE
    No, not just like that. There was a price. There were trials, torture, pain 
    and suffering... of sorts.
  BUFFY
    Of sorts?
  SPIKE
    Well, it's all relative, isn't it?
  BUFFY
    Meaning?
  SPIKE
    Meaning I have come to redefine the words pain and suffering since I fell 
    in love with you.
  BUFFY
    (sighs) How can you say that?
  SPIKE
    Apparently, I just slaughtered half of Sunnydale, pet. I'm not really worried 
    about being polite anymore.
  BUFFY
    (nods) So, that's what this is about. (stands, crosses arms) You feeling sorry 
    for yourself, Spike?
  SPIKE
    I'm feeling honest with myself. You used me.
  BUFFY
    Yes.
  SPIKE
    You told me that, of course. I never understood it though. Not until now. 
    You hated yourself, and you took it out on me.
  BUFFY
    You figured that out just now?
  SPIKE
    Soul's not all about moonbeams and pennywhistles, luv. It's about self-loathing. 
    I get it. Had to travel 'round the world, but I understand you now. I understand 
    the violence inside.
  BUFFY
    Violence? William the Bloody now has insight into violence?
  SPIKE
    Not the same. As bad as I was, as evil and as wretched as I was, I never truly 
    hated myself back then. Not like I do now.

  XANDER
    How's your face? (sets glass down on desk)
  ANDREW
    OK.
  XANDER
    (starts untying him) Sorry about that. She shouldn't have hit you. (hands 
    him the glass of water) Thirsty? Go on.
  ANDREW
    (smells the water) That chick's psycho. (drinks)
  XANDER
    You don't know the half of it. She's a vengeance demon, you know. (sits in 
    chair) She's bad news.
  ANDREW
    (quickly) This one time I saw her having sex with Spike. (drinks)
  XANDER
    She's killed more men than smallpox.
  ANDREW
    Does smallpox still kill people?
  XANDER
    She's killed a lot of men. She tortures them. Anyone who incurs her wrath. 
    One time she— (pats his arm, leans back) No, never mind.
  ANDREW
    What?
  XANDER
    It's not important.
  ANDREW
    What'd she do?
  XANDER
    (leans forward) Well, there was this one guy—there was this one guy, 
    he, uh, he hurt her real bad, so she paid him back. She killed him, but she 
    did it real slow. See first she stopped his heart, then she replaced it with 
    darkness, then she made him live his life like that. But he still had to go 
    do his job and see his friends and wake up in the morning and go to bed at 
    night, but he had to do it all empty. Without anything to look forward to. 
    Ever.
  ANDREW
    (unimpressed) Sounds bad. (drinks)
  XANDER
    Well, then she tore out his intestines and rubbed it in his face and took 
    pictures of it. 
  ANDREW
    (genuine this time) Oh, God.
  XANDER
    But she's downstairs now. Don't worry about her. 
  ANDREW
    What if—
  XANDER
    (takes water away from Andrew) See, the thing is, we've all been a little 
    on edge lately. Some bad things have been happening, and the girls—they're 
    all looking for someone to blame. 
  ANDREW
    I didn't do anything—
  ANYA
    (off screen, from the hallway) You lying son of a bitch! (storms into the 
    room, storms toward Andrew) You're gonna tell us what we need to know, and 
    you're gonna tell us right now!
  Anya charges Andrew, pushing him and the chair he's in over onto the floor. 
     
  XANDER
    Anya no!
  ANDREW
    Stop it!
  Xander pulls her off of Andrew, attempting to restrain her.
  ANYA
    Get off me, Harris! (slaps Xander, he looks hurt, she mouths "I'm sorry", 
    turns back to Andrew) C'mere, you pipsqueak! (shakes Andrew's shoulders against 
    the floor)
  ANDREW
    Get her off me! I'll tell you! I'll tell you what you need to know!

  Buffy leaves the room. When she closes the door, Spike-2 is standing there

  Show scene practically frozen in time as they pause to look at Buffy. 
    Andrew's sitting on the floor. Anya's holding his shirt collar, with her arm 
    raised to a fist aimed at his head. Xander's sitting on the desk holding his

    What's that?
  BUFFY
    I heard you through the door. Who were you talking to?

    I'm fine, Buffy. Really. I'm just...feeling a bit peckish, I suppose. (looks 
    at bags of pigs blood on night table by the bed) Do you mind? 
  Buffy goes toward the blood, keeping her eye on Spike the whole time. 
    When she turns to look at the table when picking up the bag, Spike vamps out.

  Suddenly, a hand breaks through the wall behind Andrew, grabbing his chest. 
    Another breaks through and grabs his head. Andrew screams. It's Spike, pulling

    He didn't seem to want anything to do with me. I mean, he just pushed me aside 
    and charged at the wall.
  WILLOW
    Are you hurt?
  Xander and Anya come downstairs and join the conversation.
  BUFFY
    Not—not really.
  DAWN
    (to Xander) How is what's his name?
  XANDER
    He's got a good chunk taken out of his neck, but he'll be all right. Had to 
    tie him up again, but mainly just to keep him from scratching at his bandages. 
    (to Buffy) What the hell happened up there?
  BUFFY
    I-I don't know. Spike and I were having a conversation, and he was fine. I 
    mean, you know, fine as Spike can be. And then I went to check on you guys, 
    and when I got back, it was like he was a completely different person.
  WILLOW
    Different like "William the Bloody" type different?
  BUFFY
    He was talking to someone. I heard through the door, he was having this conversation. 
    And then he started singing.
  ANYA
    Maybe it's another musical. (Buffy glares) A much crappier musical.
  BUFFY
    He—he mentioned something about a song in the cellar. Uh, a-and he changed 
    there, too—I mean instantly became another person.
  XANDER
    Trigger.
  ANYA
    The horse?
  XANDER
    No, in his head. It's a trigger. It's a brainwashing term. It's how the military 
    makes sleeper agents. They-they brainwash operatives and condition them with 
    a specific trigger, like a song, that makes 'em drastically change at a moment's 
    notice.
  WILLOW
    Is this left over from your days in the Army?
  XANDER
    No, this is left over from every Army movie I've ever seen. But it makes sense. 
    We've had ghosts or something haunting us, right? Well, what if Spike's ghosts 
    have figured out a way to—not only haunt him—what if they figured 
    out how to—how to control him?
  BUFFY
    Spike said he's been seeing things since I found him in the basement.
  WILLOW
    So, he gets his soul back, he starts seeing spooky things, and he goes extra-extra-crazy.
  BUFFY
    This trigger. How do we holster—safety, or—I don't know guns. How 
    do we make it stop?
  XANDER
    Well, usually the operative completes his task and either blows his head off 
    or steals a submarine. 
  BUFFY
    All right. I need information. If Spike's a bomb, then I need to know how 
    to diffuse him. (to Dawn and Willow) You two, I wanna know what did this to 
    him. Spirits, ghosts, demons—check the lot of them. Look for anything 
    that could haunt or-or possibly control like this. I need to know exactly 
    what we're dealing with.

    goes over to him. She dips a towel in the water and washes the blood off of 
    his face. 
  SPIKE
    (wakes) Did I hurt anybody?
  BUFFY
    You took a good bite out of Andrew.
  SPIKE
    Who?
  BUFFY
    Tucker's brother.
  SPIKE
    Oh.
  BUFFY
    He'll be OK.
  SPIKE
    I don't remember.
  BUFFY
    It's OK. (stands, walks to sink)
  SPIKE
    Buffy, I don't know why.
  BUFFY
    (sighs) We think we do. Something's playing you. Some ghost or demon has figured 
    out how to control you. Got the gang researching it right now. (Spike pulls 
    himself up into sitting position using the chains) Xander has this theory 
    that you're being triggered.
  SPIKE
    Kill me.
  BUFFY
    (turns to face him) What?
  SPIKE
    Buffy, you have to kill me.
  BUFFY
    You don't understand. When I left the room earlier, I heard you talking to 
    someone—
  SPIKE
    Do you have any idea what I'm capable of? 
  BUFFY
    I was in the cellar with you. I saw what you did.
  SPIKE
    I'm not talking about the cellar. The people in the cellar got off easy. I'm 
    talking about me. Buffy, you have never met the real me.
  BUFFY
    (crosses arms) Believe me, I'm well aware of what you're capable of.
  SPIKE
    No, you got off easy too. (stands) Do you know how much blood you can drink 
    from a girl before she'll die? I do. You see, the trick is to drink just enough 
    to know how to damage them just enough so that they'll still cry when you— 
    (chokes up) 'cause it's not worth it if they don't cry.
  BUFFY
    It's not your fault. You're not the one doing this.
  SPIKE
    I already did it. It's already done. (paces, then steps purposefully toward 
    Buffy) You wanna know what I've done to girls Dawn's age? (beat) This is me 
    Buffy. You've got to kill me before I get out.
  BUFFY
    We can keep you locked up. Keep you here and we'll figure out—
  SPIKE
    Have you ever really asked yourself why you can't do it? Off me? After everything 
    I've done to you, to people around you. It's not love. We both know that.
  BUFFY
    You fought by my side. You've saved lives. You've helped—
  SPIKE
    Don't do that. (rolls eyes) Don't rationalize this into some noble act. We 
    both know the truth of it. (looks down and away) You like men who hurt you.
  BUFFY
    No.
  SPIKE
    (looks at Buffy) You need the pain we cause you. You need the hate. You need 
    it to do your job, to be the slayer.
  BUFFY
    No. I don't hate like that. Not you, or myself. Not anymore. You think you 
    have insight now because your soul's drenched in blood? You don't know me. 
    You don't even know you. Was that you who killed those people in the cellar? 
    Was that you who waited for those girls?
  SPIKE
    There's no one else.
  BUFFY
    That's not true. Listen to me. You're not alive because of hate or pain. You're 
    alive because I saw you change. Because I saw your penance. 
  SPIKE
    (lunges violently at her, but chains hold him back) Window dressing.
  BUFFY
    Be easier, wouldn't it, it if were an act, but it's not. (walks toward him) 
    You faced the monster inside of you and you fought back. You risked everything 
    to be a better man.
  SPIKE
    Buffy...
  BUFFY
    (in his face) And you can be. You are. You may not see it, but I do. I do. 
    I believe in you, Spike.

    They took our files, wiped out our records. We've lost contact with operations 
    in Munich, Switzerland and Rome. We've got casualty confirmations coming in 
    from as far away as Melbourne.
  WATCHER AIDE #2
    Sir, we are crippled.
  QUENTIN TRAVERS
    (walks) It's all right, Lydia. We are still masters of our fate, still captains 
    of our souls.
  WATCHER AIDE #2
    (walks away) Yes, sir.
  QUENTIN TRAVERS
    (addresses the room) Ladies and gentlemen, our fears have been confirmed. 
    The First Evil has declared all-out war on this institution. Their first volleys 
    proved most effective. I, for one, think it's time we struck back. (paces) 
    Give me confirmations on all remaining operatives. Visuals and tacticals. 
    Highest alert. (stands still) Get them here as soon as possible. Begin preparations 
    for mobilization. Once we're accounted for, I want to be ready to move.
  WATCHER AIDE #3
    Sir?
  QUENTIN TRAVERS
    We'll be paying a visit to the hell mouth. My friends, these are the times 
    that define us. Proverbs 24:6. O, by wise council, you shall make your war.
  The Watcher's Council Headquarters blows up in a huge explosion, taking 
    out the whole building.

  52     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT
    Close up of Spike's face. Shot so instruments of torture. A man is being strapped 
    to a wood beam with a leather belt. Spike is being strapped to a construct 
    made of wood beams. Spike/First is talking to him while a robed person, a 
    priest of the First, also known as a Harbinger, straps Spike to the construct.
  SPIKE/FIRST
    You'll have to excuse the spectacle, but I've always been a bit of a sucker 
    for the old classics. (grins wickedly, fondly eyeing Spike's predicament)
  Spike is tied to the wheel-like construct with all four corners of his 
    body pulled in opposite directions. A Harbinger takes out a knife and cuts 
    Spike with it. Spike moans in excruciating pain. 
  SPIKE
    Oh!
  SPIKE/FIRST
    Oh, don't look at me that way. I wanted to do this more subtle-like. My Harbingers 
    have a tendency to call attention to themselves.
  A Harbinger cuts Spike again.
  SPIKE
    Oh!
  SPIKE/FIRST
    (leans forward) You're the one who couldn't hold his end of the bargain. You're 
    the one who couldn't take care of what's-his-name. You're the one who had 
    to make breakthroughs and learn something about himself. 
  A Harbinger cuts Spike again.
  SPIKE
    Oh!
  SPIKE/FIRST
    So now, fittingly, you're the one who gets to do the honors. (crosses arms)
  Spike/First morphs into Buffy's form.
  BUFFY/FIRST
    I have to admit, I'm glad it worked out this way. I was going to bleed Andrew, 
    but (sighs) you look a lot better with your shirt off.
  A Harbinger cranks a wheel attached to a mechanism that hoists the wheel 
    Spike's tied to into the air. Spike is now hanging from the wheel about ten 
    feet from the ground, bleeding steadily from his ritualized symbol-shaped 
    cuts.
  BUFFY/FIRST
    To be honest, I'm getting a little tired of subtle. I think it's about time 
    we brought some authority to our presence. Now, Spike, wanna see what a real 
    vampire looks like?
  Spike's blood is falling on the Seal of Danthazar that's right below him. 
    It's pooling in the grooves and being absorbed into the seal. The seal starts 
    to glow. One by one, the pointed tips of the pentagram at its center fold 
    up, forming a pyramid. Light comes out from under it. The pyramid sinks into 
    the ground. The remaining pieces of the seal follow suit. Spike glares at 
    Buffy/First, then watches the hole where the seal is. Something sticks it's 
    withered, gray, pointy-fingered hand out of the hole. A monster climbs out 
    wearing black leather. Pan up to show its horrible disfigured face. It's bald 
    with a distinct vampire forehead and brows and trademark fanged teeth. It 
    looks gaunt, with extremely hollow cheekbones. It raises its hands toward 
    the sky and looks around the room, growling menacingly.
