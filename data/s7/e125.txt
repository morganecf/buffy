  TEASER (RECAP SEGMENT):
  GILES (V.O.)
  Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer
  1     EXT.     WOODS 
    SOMEWHERE IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT
    Warren is strung up between a pair of trees. He is tied at four points, splayed 
    out like the famous DaVinci diagram. Willow, in full dark magic splendor (black 
    hair, black eyes), motions her hand toward Warren, and with a twist of her 
    wrist, removes his skin. Warren screams in agony.
  2     EXT.     ENGLISH 
    COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
    Giles is riding a horse through a field. Then he and Willow are talking in 
    front of the manor.
  WILLOW
    I killed people, Giles.
  GILES
  I've not forgotten.
  WILLOW
  When you brought me here, I thought it was to kill me. Instead, you go all Dumbledore 
  on me. 
  3     INT.     MANOR IN 
    ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
    Willow is sitting on a suitcase in an exterior doorway, talking to Giles who 
    is leaning on the doorjamb. The countryside is in the background outside the 
    manor.
  WILLOW
    I don't want to go back home just so I can screw up again. 
  GILES
  What exactly are you afraid of?
  WILLOW
  What if I go all veiny and homicidal again? And what if—
  GILES
  —they won't take you back?
  4     INT.     BRONZE 
    NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT
    Buffy, Xander, Spike and Nancy have come to the club to question Anya about 
    the worm monster that's been terrorizing Nancy.
  XANDER
    (to Anya) Did you turn this nice lady's ex into a giant worm-monster?
  ANYA
  (to Nancy) You wish it, I dish it. I thought we were clear on this. 
  5     INT.     CHAPEL 
    AT CEMETERY - NIGHT
    Lit dimly by moonlight, Buffy and Spike are talking. There is a large, simple, 
    gothic crucifix at the front of the chapel that can be seen by looking directly 
    down the central aisle. 
  SPIKE
    It's what you wanted, right? 
  BUFFY
  Tell me what happened.
  SPIKE
  Why does a man do what he mustn't? For her. 
  BUFFY
  Your soul. You got your soul back.
  END RECAP.

The Start Of Episode
  PROLOGUE:
  6     INT.     SUNNYDALE 
    AIRPORT TERMINAL - NIGHT
    Clock shows 9:24. Arriving passengers are exiting the gate into the waiting 
    area. Families and friends are reunited with their loved ones. A man exits 
    to be greeted by his wife and two daughters.
  HUSBAND
    Hi. How are you doing? 
  WIFE
  Hi, honey. Good.
  HUSBAND
  And how's it going with you two?
  DAUGHTERS
  Hi, Dad.
  Another family exits the plane together: a father, a daughter, and a son. 
    The daughter pushes the son, who drops his backpack, and the daughter trips 
    over it.
  DAUGHTER
  Go on. (pushes him) See what you did?
  FATHER
  Hey, stop acting up!
  Buffy, Xander and Dawn are waiting at the gate for Willow to deplane. Xander 
    is holding a white sign with "WELCOME BACK WILLOW" written on it 
    in yellow crayon.
  XANDER
  You think she'll get the sign?
  BUFFY
  Get the sign? I don't think she's gonna see the sign.
  DAWN
  Why is it so pale?
  XANDER
  I used yellow crayon. It was a thing from when I talked to Willow on the bluff. 
  I hope she gets it.
  DAWN
  Oh, tell us again what you said.
  XANDER
  Well, I was talking from my heart and I knew Evil Willow wasn't really ready 
  to— You were kidding.
  DAWN
  Mm-hmm. A little bit.
  BUFFY
  We've heard the crayon speech a few times. Not that it's not great, of course.
  XANDER
  I saved the world with talking from my mouth. My mouth saved the world.
  DAWN
  Uh-huh. I'm getting nervous. Are you nervous?
  BUFFY
  Yeah. It's gonna be weird seeing her. What do you say to someone in this situation?
  XANDER
  I'm gonna say "Hi, Willow."
  BUFFY
  C'mon. You're saying it's not going to be the least bit strange? We saw her 
  kill someone. She was about to kill Dawn—
  XANDER
  And Giles wouldn't let her leave unless she completed that whatever recovery 
  course.
  DAWN
  Right. (Buffy smiles guiltily. Dawn looks at Buffy) Right?
  BUFFY
  She kinda didn't finish.
  DAWN
  She didn't finish? She didn't finish being not evil?
  BUFFY
    H-he said it was really important that she come back early and that she was 
    doing really well and we shouldn't worry.
  XANDER
  Guys, I just noticed something. Everyone's off the plane, so where's Willow?
  Cut to:
  7     INT.     SUNNYDALE 
    AIRPORT TERMINAL - NIGHT
    Clock shows 9:24. Arriving passengers are exiting the gate into the waiting 
    area. Looks like the same passengers that exited last scene. A man exits to 
    be greeted by his wife and two daughters.
  HUSBAND
    Hi. How are you doing? 
  WIFE
  Hi, honey. Good.
  HUSBAND
  And how's it going with you two?
  DAUGHTERS
  Hi, Dad.
  Another family exits the plane together: a father, a daughter, and a son. 
    The daughter pushes the son, who drops his backpack, and the daughter trips 
    over it.
  DAUGHTER
  Go on. (pushes him) See what you did?
  FATHER
  Hey, stop acting up!
  This time, Willow deplaned right behind the family. She looks around desperately 
    for her friends, but they are nowhere to be found. She seems deflated and 
    disappointed.
  WILLOW
  Welcome home, me.
  END TEASERS.
  Opening credits and title sequence.

  ACT I.
  8     EXT.     CONSTRUCTION 
    SITE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH SCHOOL - NIGHT
    A Teen Boy is spray-painting graffiti on a earth retention wall at the construction 
    site where dirt has been removed below the grade . He's painting the word 
    "Spider" when something unseen stalks him from the shadows.
  GNARL (O.S.)
    All alone. (clicks fingernails together) Are you frightened to be all 
    alone?
  TEEN BOY
  (stops painting) Is somebody there?
  GNARL (O.S.)
  The wind talks when you're alone. (laughs)
  TEEN BOY
  You better clear out, whoever you are.
  There's a shrieking noise and then the boy screams.

  9     EXT.     FRONT 
    DOOR AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Willow knocks on the front door but no one answers.
  Cut to:
  10     INT.     KITCHEN 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Willow knocks on the outside back door, and when there's no answer she lets 
    herself in. 
  WILLOW
  Buffy? Hello?
  She walks into the other room. When she passes the microwave oven, its clock 
    says 10:41.
  Cut to:
  11     INT.     HALL 
    STAIRCASE AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Willow walks upstairs slowly.
  Cut to:
  12     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    The sign on Willow and Tara's old room says "Buffy." Willow goes 
    into the room and looks around sadly. Buffy has moved in. Willow walks toward 
    the window, touches it, and remembers the sound of Tara's fatal gunshot breaking 
    the glass. She looks at Buffy's pictures and sees pictures of all their friends, 
    except Willow herself. She picks up Buffy's day planner, which has contact 
    info for Buffy, Xander and Dawn. A dog barks outside, and there's a noise 
    like a front door opening. Willow drops the planner and rushes out of the 
    room.
  Cut to:
  13     INT.     HALL 
    STAIRCASE AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Willow's coming down the stairs excitedly, looking for her friends.
  WILLOW
  Dawn? Did I hear the door?
  Again, no one is there. She walks into the living room disappointed.
  14     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Unable to find her friends, Willow curls up on the couch to wait until they 
    come home. She falls asleep.
  Cut to:
  15     INT.     KITCHEN 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Shot of the microwave oven: its clock says 10:41.
  Cut to:
  16     INT.     FOYER 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Buffy, Xander, and Dawn come home and enter through the front door, talking 
    about Willow. 
  BUFFY
  They absolutely put her on the plane in London.
  XANDER
  So, she got off in Chicago when they stopped?
  DAWN
  She could've caught a flight anywhere from there.
  BUFFY
  (crosses arms) Maybe she doubled back. Got off the plane in London after Giles 
  left.
  DAWN
  Well, if she's doing that—ducking Giles—then, she's evil, right?
  XANDER
  Well, I've avoided Giles tons of times. Just meant I was lazy, not evil.
  BUFFY
  I hope you're right, because defeating Lazy Willow—probably less hard.
  DAWN
    We should check the messages... see if she tried to reach us here.
  BUFFY
  'S a good idea.
  The sound of Willow dropping the planner comes from upstairs.
  DAWN
  What was that?
  BUFFY
  Upstairs.
  17     INT.     HALL STAIRCASE 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Xander, Buffy and Dawn go up the stairs to investigate.
  XANDER
  Willow, is that you?
  Cut to:
  18     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    A few minutes later, Buffy and Dawn come down the stairs. Xander is sitting 
    on the couch, and they go to sit down beside him.
  BUFFY
  Definitely not up there.
  DAWN
  She didn't leave a message.
  BUFFY
  I checked with Giles again, too. Hasn't heard from her.
  XANDER
  Is he throwing a tasteful British wiggins?
  BUFFY
  Oh, with extra wig. He's blaming himself pretty hard, like he should've known 
  she wasn't ready to come back. I-I kept telling him, you know, it wasn't his 
  fault. Maybe something about us she couldn't face.
  XANDER
  Like she didn't think we were ready to forgive her? I get that.
  DAWN
  So Giles is blaming Giles, and we're blaming us. Is anyone gonna blame Willow? 
  Oh, don't give me shock face. I mean, will anyone around here ever start asking 
  for help when they need it?
  BUFFY
    Look, if Willow flipped out, it's her bad. We can only be here for her so 
    much if she won't be, you know, here.
  Shot of the couch. Xander, Dawn, and Buffy are sitting beside each other 
    on it. They begin to fade away, while another image appears in their place: 
    Willow is sleeping on the sofa they were talking on.
  19     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Willow wakes up. She has apparently slept on the couch all night. It's morning 
    now. She gets up and goes to the phone and dials it.
  WILLOW
  Hello. I'm calling for Giles, uh, Mr. Giles. (pause) Right. Council meeting 
  all day. (pause) No, no, I know, he can't be reached there. Thanks. Bye.
  Willow hangs up the phone and looks around the room trying to figure out 
    what to do.
  Cut to:
  20     EXT.     SUNNYDALE 
    STREET IN FRONT OF MAGIC BOX - DAY
    Willow is walking down the bustling street toward the old Magic Box storefront. 
    It's burned and boarded up. Anya comes out the front door with a box full 
    of salvaged items. Willow runs up to her, excited to see her.
  WILLOW
  Anya!
  Anya sees Willow and steps back defensively.
  WILLOW
  Anya, don't! Don't run away. 
  ANYA
  What are you doing here? I thought you were with Giles studying how to not kill 
  people.
  WILLOW
  I just got back.
  ANYA
  Just got back, as in you're all better, or just got back to bring about a fiery 
  apocalypse of death.
  WILLOW
  Neither, but I-I have been studying, working real hard, and I-I'm gonna be fine.
  ANYA
    Oh. Good. 'Cause I remember the last time you said that. I've spent a lot 
    of time since them cleaning the debris out of my ex-livelihood. Stuff like 
    that.
  WILLOW
  Well, yeah, I wanna help any way I can with that. I-I feel really responsible.
  ANYA
  (walks towards her) You feel really responsible? You are really responsible!
  WILLOW
  I-I know I hurt you and—and everyone. I'm sorry.
  ANYA
  Here's something you should know about vengeance demons: We don't group with 
  the "sorry." We prefer "Oh, God, please stop hitting me with 
  my own rib bones."
  WILLOW
  Go on. Say whatever you want. Rib bones and so forth. I-I deserve it.
  ANYA
    Then you won't mind? (Willow shakes her head no) Well, then, that's no fun.
  WILLOW
  Sorry.
  Willow sits down on the curb side in front of the store. Anya sighs, puts 
    the box she's holding down beside Willow and sits down next to it. Willow 
    picks up a large, three-horned animal skull from the box to play with while 
    she talks.
  WILLOW
  So, um, where is everyone these days?
  ANYA
  Well, I'm back in my own apartment. And, of course, vengeance takes me all over 
  the world. I was in Brazil yesterday. They love their soccer.
  WILLOW
  And the others? Dawn, and, uh, Xander, Buffy?
  Willow accidentally breaks off one of the prongs on the skill, and quickly 
    puts it back in the box.
  ANYA
  You haven't seen them?
  WILLOW
  Not so much.
  ANYA
  Huh. I guess they're still mad at you. They've been a little temperamental lately, 
  just between you and me. We had this little mix-up a few days ago, and —
  WILLOW
  That sounds great. So, um, where do you think they'd be?
  ANYA
  Oh, at the new high school, probably. Everyone's all about the high school. 
  Buffy's got some kind of job there helping junior deviants, Spike's insane in 
  the basement, Xander's there doing construction on the new gym—
  WILLOW
  Wait, Spike's what in the whatment?
  ANYA
  Insane. Base. Xander does construction. He likes to start early, so he's probably 
  there by now.
  Cut to:
  21     EXT.     CONSTRUCTION 
    SITE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
    Willow walks up to the edge of the pit where they're doing construction. Willow 
    calls out over the site, looking around for Xander.
  WILLOW
  Xander? Xander, you down there?
  No answer, so she climbs down the retaining wall on a ladder. This is the 
    retaining wall that the Teen Boy was painting last night. Willow walks around 
    and stops suddenly when she looks down. Zoom to a dead person lying on the 
    ground with no skin.
  22     EXT.     CONSTRUCTION 
    SITE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
    Zoom back up to where Willow was standing, but now there's Buffy and Xander 
    instead.
  BUFFY
  No skin.
  XANDER
  Tough to look at.
  BUFFY
  And yet my eyes refuse to look away. Stupid eyes.
  XANDER
    I found it first thing this morning. I gave my crew the day off, and I called 
    you right away. 
  BUFFY
  I got to get a job where I don't get called right away for this stuff.
  Xander wipes his mouth. There's a clanking noise coming from behind him. 
    On camera, a panicked Willow climbs the ladder to leave the site, but when 
    Xander turns to look at the noise behind him, he sees only an empty ladder. 
    He turns back to look at the dead person, and continues talking to Buffy.
  XANDER
  Yeah, I know exactly what you're thinking. Maybe Willow is back.
  Fade to black.
  ACT II.
  23     INT.     HALLWAY 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Students are walking around in the hallways between classes. Willow is walking 
    down the hall as well. The bell rings, and the students rush to their classes. 
    She finds the basement door that reads "Basement. No Student Access." 
    She opens the door and walks down the stairs into the basement.
  24     INT.     BASEMENT 
    SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Willow walks around the basement looking around. There are spare bookshelves 
    and other classroom equipment stored there. Then Spike jumps out from out 
    of nowhere and yells at her.
  SPIKE
    Out! This is my place. You need permission to be here. You need a special 
    slip with a stamp.
  WILLOW
    Spike. My God... I— 
  SPIKE
  (ranting, pacing) You go off and try to wall up the bad parts and put your heart 
  back in where it fell out. You call yourself finished, but you're not. Worse 
  than ever, you are...
  Spike stops pacing and stands still with his head tilted down a little. 
    He's silent and pensive. Then he walks forward with a confused expression 
    on his face. In an entirely different demeanor, more restrained and calm, 
    he starts talking again, but not facing Willow.
  SPIKE
  You went away. You've been gone since...
  WILLOW
  I needed to go, but I'm back now. And I found... There's a body.
  SPIKE
  Tragedy. (faces Willow) Is there blood?
  WILLOW
  Uh, I, Yeah, and I can't find Buffy or Xander or Dawn. And there's this thing 
  killing people. And the victim was... skinned. What could do that?
  SPIKE
  You did it once. I heard about it.
  WILLOW
  Anything other—other than me?
  Spike is not facing Willow, but instead, he's facing ninety degrees away 
    from her. Smiling sweetly all of a sudden, he's no longer talking to her. 
    He walks forward several steps and starts talking again.
  SPIKE
  Look at you... glowing. What's a word means "glowing"? Gotta rhyme.
  WILLOW
  Spike?
  SPIKE
  Oh, ah, no. I-I-I should hide. Hide from you. Hide my face. You know what I 
  did.
  WILLOW
  What you did? You didn't do anything... did you?
  SPIKE
  Everyone's talking to me. No one's talking to each other.
  Spike turns to face Willow suspiciously.
  WILLOW
    Spike, please try to listen to me.
  Now, more confident, Spike starts pacing slowly. He steps behind one of 
    the bookcases, talking to himself. Willow's confused.
  SPIKE
  Someone isn't here. Button, button... who's got the button? My money's on (stops 
  and faces Willow) the witch.
  Cut to:
  25     INT.     BASEMENT 
    SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Xander and Buffy are walking together in the basement, talking.
  XANDER
  We can't use the blueprints to find our way around down here. It's like the 
  walls move or something.
  Off screen, Spike can be heard yelling.
  SPIKE (O.S.)
  Out! This is my place. 
  BUFFY
  (to Xander) I think I hear him.
  SPIKE (O.S.)
  You need permission to be here. You need a special slip with a stamp.
  Buffy and Xander follow his voice and open a door to the area where Spike 
    is pacing back and forth, apparently talking to himself.
  SPIKE
  (ranting, pacing) ... and put your heart back in where it fell out. You call 
  yourself finished, but you're not. Worse than ever, you are...
  Spike stops pacing and stands still with his head tilted down a little. 
    He's silent and pensive. 
  BUFFY
  Spike. Spike. 
  Then he walks forward with a confused expression on his face. In an entirely 
    different demeanor, more restrained and calm, he starts talking again to Buffy.
  SPIKE
  You went away. You've been gone since...
  BUFFY
  The church. You scared me a little. I didn't—I didn't know what to think.
  XANDER
  We're here for a reason, Spike.
  SPIKE
  Tragedy. (faces right, away from Xander and Buffy) Is there blood?
  XANDER
  He knows. He must have seen the body.
  SPIKE
  You did it once. I heard about it.
  BUFFY
  Spike, we need to know who did this.
  Spike is smiling sweetly all of a sudden. He walks forward several steps 
    and starts talking again.
  SPIKE
  Look at you... glowing. What's a word means "glowing"? Gotta rhyme.
  BUFFY
  Spike, please...
  SPIKE
  I-I-I should hide. Hide from you. Hide my face. You know what I did.
  XANDER
  Boy, he's extra-useful today.
  BUFFY
  (whispering to Xander) This isn't the time.
  SPIKE
  Everyone's talking to me. No one's talking to each other.
  Spike turns to face over his right shoulder suspiciously.
  BUFFY
  (to Xander) Might as well go.
  Now, more confident, Spike starts pacing slowly. He steps behind one of 
    the bookcases, talking to himself. Buffy and Xander start walking away.
  SPIKE
    Someone isn't here. Button, button... who's got the button? My money's on 
    (stops and faces his right) the witch.
  Buffy and Xander stop in their tracks and turn around to face Spike again.
  SPIKE
  Red's a bad girl.
  BUFFY
  He's talking about Willow.
  XANDER
  And that means something because he's chock-full-o-sanity.
  BUFFY
  Maybe he saw her.
  SPIKE
  They think you did it. The slayer and her boy. They think you took the skin.
  BUFFY
  Is there something here? Something that killed?
  XANDER
  (offended) Her boy? I'm her boy?
  Spike walks up to Xander and Buffy.
  SPIKE
  I have to go. There are things here without permission. I have to check their 
  slips. Make sure they have authorization.
  Spike walks away, deeper into the basement.

  26     INT.     ANYA'S 
    APARTMENT - DAY
    Willow knocks on Anya's door. Anya opens it.
  WILLOW
  I need help.
  ANYA
  I don't have any money.
  WILLOW
  I don't want money.
  Willow walks into the apartment without waiting for an invitation. Anya 
    looks peeved.
  ANYA
  Come in. Enjoy my personal space. (shuts door)
  WILLOW
  I found a dead body near the high school.
  ANYA
  Yes, that can happen.
  WILLOW
  Something horrible killed a boy. Took his skin right off.
  Anya and Willow have the same reaction at the same moment, and speak simultaneously.
  ANYA & WILLOW
  Was it you? (shocked) No.
  ANYA
  Well with the skin thing, they're definitely going to think it was you. Buffy 
  is, anyway.
  WILLOW
  Yeah. I mean maybe she already does. I don't know. I just—I-I have to find 
  whatever did this. I just—I need to do something right.
  ANYA
  Oh, and so they'll think it wasn't you, right? I mean, that has to be part of 
  it. Maybe you're even thinking you kill this thing, they don't even have to 
  know about it. Won't suspect you, even for a minute.
  WILLOW
  No, I-I don't— When did you get all insightful?
  ANYA
  I'm surprisingly sensitive.
  WILLOW
  So, will you help me?
  ANYA
  (sighs) Is it difficult or time-consuming?
  Cut to:
  27     INT.     ANYA'S 
    APARTMENT - DAY
    Now the curtains in Anya's apartment are closed, blocking the sunlight. Candles 
    are lit and she and Willow are sitting on the floor, Indian-style, facing 
    each other, with a map of Sunnydale between them.
  ANYA
  This isn't going to get all sexy, is it?
  WILLOW
    I'd be shocked. OK, do you have your powder?
  ANYA
  Oh, I ate that. I have it.
  WILLOW
  OK, we scatter it over the map, and everywhere there's a demon, a little light 
  appears.
  ANYA
  Oh, pretty! Will it hurt the carpet?
  WILLOW
  No. (pauses to clear her thoughts) OK, scatter.
  Willow and Anya dust the map with the powder from their individual jars. 
    Several individual dots glow in various places on the map, but there is a 
    heavy concentration of glowing dots in the center of the map.
  ANYA & WILLOW
  Oh!
  ANYA
  Hey look—that's me! Hello. What's that huge clump?
  WILLOW
  It's the high school. It's all hellmouthy is underneath.
  ANYA
  Things have been stirring there lately. Is it getting brighter?
  WILLOW
  Smoke!
  The clump of lights at the high school gets brighter and brighter until 
    it catches the map on fire. Willow and Anya stand up immediately, and Willow 
    stamps out the fire with her foot. Anya is upset and bends down to investigate 
    the damage.
  ANYA
  Ah! OK. Remember our talk about the carpet?
  Willow holds up the map to inspect the marks left behind on it by the glowing 
    lights.
  WILLOW
  Thi-this could be it. It's strong, it's near the body, and it's all by itself, 
  hiding in the woods or-or maybe cave. There are a couple of good caves around 
  there.
  ANYA
  I don't know. Sounds pretty thin to me.
  Anya starts cleaning up the mark on the rug.
  WILLOW
  Well, that's why you teleport over there real quick like a bunn—real quick 
  and, uh, see if I'm right.
  ANYA
  No. Sorry. You damaged my carpet.
  WILLOW
  Anya, you're a vengeance demon. Just teleport!
  ANYA
  Well, as it turns out, teleporting isn't a right, it's a privilege. I withdrew 
  a vengeance spell last week, and this is my punishment. I can only teleport 
  for official business. I have to file a flight plan and everything.
  WILLOW
  Oh. I'm sorry. That must be hard.
  ANYA
  Yeah, it bites a pretty big one. And the vengeance itself, i-it's not as fulfilling 
  as I remember.
  WILLOW
  Really? 'Cause I got the impression that you enjoyed—you know, inflicting.
  ANYA
  Well, causing pain sounds really cool, I know, but turns out it's really upsetting. 
  Didn't use to be, but now it is.
  Anya walks around, still fussing over the carpet stain.
  WILLOW
  Is it like you're scared of losing that feeling again. And that having it be 
  OK to hurt people. And then you're not in charge of the power anymore because 
  it's in charge of you?
  ANYA
  Wow, that was really over-dramatically stated, but, yeah, that's it.
  WILLOW
  I get it. Believe me.
  ANYA
  (sincerely) I'm sorry, Willow. I wish it were better for you.
  WILLOW
    You too.
  ANYA
  It did get a little sexy, didn't it?
  WILLOW
  (nods, then catches herself, walks away quickly) I have to find this monster.
  ANYA
  (holding candles now) Willow... um, isn't there another spell? I mean, you're 
  trying to find Buffy and Xander. Couldn't we use a spell to do that?
  WILLOW
  I did. I-I tried, and something went kaflooey, and it didn't work. 
  ANYA
  What did it say?
  WILLOW
  It said they don't exist.
  Willow walks out of the apartment and closes the door behind her. Anya blows 
    out the candles.

    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Dawn, Buffy, and Xander are sitting around the dining room table doing research. 
    Buffy has several books open in front of her, while Dawn is surfing the Internet 
    on her laptop. Xander has a book in his lap.
  DAWN
  OK, so I looked up demons that skin their victims and demons that flay their 
  victims 'cause, you know, same thing. There's a ton of prospects. Anything else 
  gone? Uh, eyeballs, toenails or viscera? That's guts.
  BUFFY
  She knows about viscera. Makes you proud.
  XANDER
  Just skin.
  DAWN
  OK, I'll work on that.
  Buffy sighs, stands up, and walks to a corner of the room. Xander follows.
  XANDER
  What's up?
  BUFFY
  I need to do something. I just—I have this feeling in my gut—
  XANDER
  In your viscera!
  BUFFY
  —that we know exactly who did this. And all of this work that we're doing is 
  just a way for us to convince ourselves that Willow's OK.
  DAWN
  Oh, guys! (gesturing them to come over to her) I got a good one. A demon called 
  "Gnarl." He's a parasite with these nasty long fingernails. He secretes 
  something through them and uses that to paralyze his victims. He then cuts strips 
  of their skin while they're still alive. It takes hours.
  XANDER
  We didn't find any strips of skin. Which, by the way, (shudders) gghhhh!
  DAWN
  You wouldn't. He eats them. That's why he's a parasite. It's like his natural 
  food.
  BUFFY
  Dawn, you're new at this, and I get why you're proud, but I'm not exactly sure 
  why this demon is any more likely than any of the others.
  DAWN
  You never said pool of blood.
  BUFFY
  There was no pool, just splatters.
  DAWN
  (smiling) Then this is your guy. He laps up the blood. You could say it's like 
  his natural beverage.
  XANDER
    (points at Dawn) You're terrifying.
  DAWN
  Now if we just knew how to find this thing.
  XANDER
  Well, we could ask some questions over at Willy's place.
  BUFFY
  Or, we could be smart. Sorry, Xander.
  XANDER
  What?
  BUFFY
  W-whoever did this had to get blood on them, which means they left a trail. 

  DAWN
  Right, minute traces of blood.
  BUFFY
  And we have a way to track it.
  DAWN
  We have a— Oh, I get it.
  XANDER
  What? How? What's going on?

    NEAR SUNNYDALE - NIGHT
    Spike's walking around, mumbling to himself. 
  SPIKE
    William's a good boy. Carries her water, carries her sin. Supposed to 
    get easier, isn't it. Supposed to help to help, but it doesn't. Still so heavy.
  Xander, Buffy, and Dawn are following Spike.
  XANDER
  Should've put a leash on him.
  BUFFY
  Yes, let's tie ourselves to the crazy vampire.
  XANDER
    You really think it's gonna work?
  BUFFY
  It's pretty easy. Spike follows the exciting smell of blood, and we follow the 
  fairly ripe smell of Spike.
  DAWN
  It's smellementary. Also, I'm sure there's tons of stuff like this. You know, 
  procedures we can use that don't involve magic spells. Just good solid detective 
  work. And we can develop a database of tooth impressions and demon skin samples 
  and I could wear high heels more often.
  BUFFY
  Wow, that was so close to being empowered.
  DAWN
  Everybody loves a slender ankle.
  Spike has stopped walking. He's standing still staring through the bushes 
    at a rock cliff. The group catches up to him.
  SPIKE
  That's it. End of the line. Everyone off. (turns to Xander) Keep your ticket, 
  you'll need that.
  BUFFY
  That's a rock cliff.
  XANDER
  Well, give him a break, Buffy. Maybe it's a vicious skin-eating rock cliff.
  SPIKE
  There's a cave in it. Look. (pushes the bush aside) I'm insane. What's his excuse?

  XANDER
  Dark and dank. I was hoping it'd be dark and dank.
  Buffy gestures for him to stop talking. There are some noises.
  BUFFY
  Shh! Do you hear that?
  XANDER
  No, I don't. But now I do.

    Willow is standing still, looking around to see what's there, who's talking 
    to her.
  GNARL (O.S.)
  Look at the shorn lamb. See how he trembles. Is it the cold wind? Or is it that 
  the flock is nowhere to be seen? 
  Where Willow was standing, now Buffy, Dawn, and Xander are standing. They 
    can hear Gnarl speaking, but can't see Willow. 
  GNARL (O.S.)
  Poor little lamb all alone. 
  DAWN
    You guys hear that, right?
  XANDER
  Yep.
  BUFFY
    It's echoing. I know it sounds close, but I don't think—
  Gnarl jumps out suddenly and scratches Dawn before leaving again.
  BUFFY
  Dawn! Are you OK?
  DAWN
  I guess so. (sounds weak, uncovers her stomach to show a large gash across it) 
  Poison paralyzes.
  BUFFY
  Dawn. OK, we need to get her out of here. We'll deal with him later. Seal him 
  in.
  Buffy and Xander leave carrying an injured Dawn out of the cave.

  Protect me, Goddess. In thy name, I supplicate myself. Take the powers from 
  my enemy, and lay him lower than the lowest field.
  GNARL (O.S.)
  Gnarl loves spells. He keeps them as pets. They love him. And they leave him 
  alone. (laughs)
  While he talks, Willow tries to push the rocks away from the entrance, but 
    fails. She turns to face Gnarl again.
  WILLOW
  You may be immune to magic, but I've got more than that. You wanna fight?
  GNARL (O.S.)

    Xander and Buffy carry Dawn between them, with one of her arms around each

  BUFFY
  The computer. That thing Dawn was reading might have an antidote for the paralysis.
  DAWN
  (without moving her lips) Um, Buffy?
  BUFFY
  What?
  DAWN
  I'm really sorry.
  BUFFY
    Oh, it's OK.

    Willow's looking around trying to find her pursuer.
  GNARL (O.S.)
    Did they leave you as a gifty for me? Are you a tasty little gifty?
  WILLOW
    Stop it!
  GNARL (O.S.)
    Or did they just throw you away?
  WILLOW
    Were they here? Were my friends really here? I heard something.
  Gnarl swoops in and slices her belly with his paralyzing fingernail. Willow 
    falls back against the wall and sinks to the floor. Gnarl's shadow is on the 
    wall behind her.
  WILLOW
    (in pain) Ah, ah...
  GNARL
    They were here. Here they were. And there they went. (singing) Gone, all gone, 
    what a pretty song. (talking) They sealed you in with me. (grabs her ankle 
    and pulls her toward him) I love a gifty. (squats over her) Can't wait to 
    unwrap it. (clicks nails)
  Gnarl is a 5 foot tall green-skinned creature whose rib-cage shows through 
    his leathery skin. He has pointy ears, a long hooked nose, and yellow eyes. 
    His fingernails are black and he likes to click them together, making a tik-tik 
    noise like a dog walking on tile.
  Gnarl pushes Willow's blouse away from her wound to examine her. He bends 
    over her belly and starts licking it. She winces.

  They take her to the living room.

  Sofa.
  They put her down on the sofa, but she rolls over face-down in the pillows.
  DAWN
  (without moving mouth) Face up! Face up!
  XANDER
  (rolling her over) She's right, face up is better.
  BUFFY
  (sighs) OK, I'm gonna check the computer. Find that page. See if there's an 
  antidote.
  Buffy leaves the room.
  XANDER
  It'll be all right. We'll get you fixed up. You'll be doing limbo in no time.

  Buffy walks back into the living room.

    Xander is kneeling beside Dawn, holding her hand as she is laid out paralyzed 
    on the couch.
  BUFFY
  Guess we have to go back.
  XANDER
  We can't just leave her here like this. What if she vomits?
  DAWN
  (without moving mouth) Ew. I won't vomit. 
  BUFFY
  Do you think she'll vomit?
  DAWN
  (without moving mouth) Stop talking about vomit.
  BUFFY
  I'll call Anya. She can watch her.
  XANDER
  Right, she'll love being called for vomit watch.

  GNARL
  Gnarl makes a pretty picture. (scratches her again) It's easy when you know 
  how. It's easy when everyone helps. They helped me. (licks her blood off his 
  fingernail) Too bad there's no one to help you.
  Gnarl removes a strip of skin about the size of a French fry from her stomach. 
    He dangles it over his mouth and sucks it in like spaghetti, savoring every 
    morsel of her raw flesh. He groans with pleasure and bends over to lick her 
    stomach again. Willow's face shows her agony.
  Cut to:

    Anya has arrived to look after Dawn. Buffy and Xander are getting ready to 
    fight Gnarl.
  ANYA
  I bet she's dying.
  BUFFY
  She's not dying. She's just paralyzed.
  ANYA
  Oh. Paralyzed how?
  XANDER
  Paralyzed how? In the not moving way.
  ANYA
  Well, there's lots of different ways. Did you try this?
  Anya takes Dawn's legs and lifts them up ninety degrees, bending her at 
    the waist. Her legs don't fall back down.
  BUFFY
  Hey!
  DAWN
  (without moving her lips) Hey!
  XANDER
  Oh! You're poseable.
  BUFFY
  She's poseable?
  ANYA
  It's a common variety. Watch this.
  Anya rearranges Dawn so that she's sitting on the couch now, upright.
  ANYA
  Huh. Neat as you please. Hardly a need to undo her.
  BUFFY
  (mouthful of nuts) Where'd you get the nuts?
  ANYA
    Brazil. No need to thank me, by the way, for sitting with her. I'm feeling 
    very benevolent today. Helping Willow. Helping you. You might even call it 
    even for that whole worm thing last week.
  BUFFY
  Yeah, I don't think we could call— Wait, you saw Willow?
  ANYA
  Um-hmm. Oh, she's looking for you, by the way. Decided you might be out in some 
  cave. Sounded pretty tenuous.
  DAWN
  (without moving her lips) Cave?
  BUFFY
  Anya, listen. This is really important. Did Willow go to that cave?
  ANYA
  Mm-hmm. Last time I saw her, that's where she was headed. (turning to Dawn) 
  Shall I make her salute? That'd be very cute.
  BUFFY
  Xander, she could be there right now. Willow could be trapped with the Gnarl.
  ANYA
  (playing with Dawn's hand) Uh, it's not "The Gnarl", just "Gnarl". 
  Oh, wouldn't it be tragic if you were here being kinda silly with your comically 
  paralyzed sister while Willow was dying?
  Buffy walks over to Anya, with a battle-axe in hand.
  BUFFY
  Anya, you know about this creature?
  ANYA
  Uh-huh, sure.
  BUFFY
  You're coming with us.
  Buffy hands the battle-axe to Anya, who looks it over. Anya finishes posing 
    Dawn in a two-finger salute, pats Dawn on the head, and walks off. Dawn grunts 
    with displeasure. Buffy and Xander walked out as well, but Buffy runs back 
    in to place the remote in Dawn's posed hand before leaving again. Dawn squeaks.

  GNARL
  (laughing) They don't want you. (singing) Lock you in, nice white skin... (talking) 
  And if they do return, where will the find you? Inside me, you'll already be.

  Buffy bursts into the cave and Gnarl leaps up. Buffy tries to cut him with 
    her sword. Gnarl screeches and hides.
  BUFFY
  What's going on? Where's Willow?
  ANYA
  She's right here. Can't you see her? She's hurt!
  XANDER
  What? Where? (feels around with his hand) There's nothing here.
  ANYA
  Your hand—it's going right through her. (to Buffy) What's going on?
  BUFFY
  I don't know, but I'm starting to get why we haven't seen her.
  XANDER
  Because we haven't seen her.
  BUFFY
  I have this feeling that whatever's causing this invisible thing is a whole 
  separate issue from the skin-eating monster.
  ANYA
  Behind you!
  Gnarl tries to scratch Buffy, but misses, getting only her shirt and not 
    her skin.
  BUFFY
  Close one.
  Gnarl has a sword now, and Buffy has a dagger. They fight, alternating swipes 
    at each other.
  ANYA
  Remember what I said. Get him in the eyes. (kneels beside Willow) Willow, I'm 
  here. Wow, you're really hurt.
  WILLOW
  (without moving her mouth) What's going on?
  ANYA
  Buffy's fighting the demon over there, see. But if they get too close, I'm gonna 
  have to run.
  WILLOW
  (without moving her mouth) I don't see.
  ANYA
  But they're here. Buffy and Xander. 
  WILLOW
  (without moving her mouth) They came? They didn't leave me?

  ANYA
  Good. You're doing really good.
  Buffy and Gnarls are still fighting. Gnarl leaps over Buffy's head and lands 
    behind her. She turns and stabs his foot with her dagger when he lands, pinning 
    him to the ground. He screeches and flails, throwing him off guard. She grabs 
    his head with both hands and plunges her thumbs into his eyes. 
  XANDER
  (to Buffy) Ew. Ew. Thumbs? I can't believe you did that.

    I-I don't know how badly you're hurt, but—
  Willow appears on the ground in front of them, also in mid-sentence.
  XANDER
  Is that Willow?
  WILLOW
  —I couldn't find you guys and I looked everywhere. And the demon said that 
  you left me and— Oh, there you are. There you are! Don't go away.

    Willow's sitting on the bed in pajamas in Buffy's old bedroom, meditating. 
    Buffy walks up to the doorway, sees her, and decides not to interrupt her. 
    Willow opens her eyes. 
  WILLOW
  Buffy...
  BUFFY
  Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.
  WILLOW
  That's all I had left in me anyway.
  BUFFY
  I didn't realize meditating was such hard work.
  WILLOW
  I'm healing. Growing new skin.
  BUFFY
  (walks toward Willow) Wow. That's magic, right? I mean, when most people when 
  they meditate don't get extra skin, right. 'Cause Clem should, like, cut back. 
  (sits on edge of bed)
  WILLOW
  It's magic. I'm drawing power from the earth to heal myself.
  BUFFY
  We're on the second floor.
  WILLOW
  (laughs) You know Giles says everything's part of the earth. This bed. The air. 
  Us.
  BUFFY
  Explains why my fingernails get dirty even when I don't do anything.
  WILLOW
  Plus you stuck your thumbs in a demon.
  BUFFY
  True.
  Willow leans back, exhausted.
  BUFFY
  You're wiped out. I-I should go.
  WILLOW
  No. Please stay. I missed you so much when I couldn't find you.
  BUFFY
  We missed you too. I missed you. Dawn's, uh, working on what caused the mutual 
  no-see-ums, but so far we haven't—
  WILLOW
  I did it.
  BUFFY
  You did a spell?
  WILLOW
  I didn't mean to. I-I just remember thinking I wasn't ready to see you guys 
  yet. I was afraid we wouldn't, you know, connect.
  BUFFY
  So, you made it happen just by thinking it?
  WILLOW
  Guess I have a ways to go before I master my powers, huh?
  BUFFY
  It's OK. As long as you're all right.
  WILLOW
  It's nice to be forgiven. Too bad I need so much of it.
  BUFFY
  I have a confession to make. I thought it might be you. With the flaying.
  WILLOW
  I know.
  BUFFY
  I wanna be the kind of person that wouldn't think that. Xander never thought 
  it.
  WILLOW
  He did, a little. Heck, I did a little. Xander has the luxury of not saying 
  it, but you're the slayer. You have to say stuff like that. It's OK. It's OK 
  too if you still don't think I can recover from this magic stuff, 'cause, honestly, 
  I'm not that sure about it either.
  Willow leans forward again, sighing, to begin meditating again.
  BUFFY
  I thought you were too tired.
  WILLOW
  It hurts too much not to try.
  BUFFY
  I'm sorry.
  WILLOW
  It just takes so much strength. I don't have that much.
  BUFFY
  I got so much strength, I'm giving it away.
  WILLOW
  Are you sure?
  BUFFY
  Will it help?
  WILLOW
  Much.
  Buffy sits cross-legged in front of Willow and holds her hands. They meditate 
    together.
  BUFFY
  Good.
