      club patrons, but she is pushed back inside. Robed men close the door behind 
      them and start to fight with her. She is knocked to the ground, lying on 
      her back. Finally, one of the robed people pulls out a Jambaya (curved silver 
      dagger) and stabs her.
  
  Cut to:
  GILES (V.O.)
    To erase all the slayers in training and their watchers, along with their

  Cut to:
  14     INT.     UNDERGROUND 
    CAVE - NIGHT
    Buffy approaches Spike slowly and cuts him loose of his tethers. When he touches 
    her and realizes she's real, he smiles and squints, searching her face intently. 
    She looks into his eyes, tapping an emotional connection between them.
  BUFFY (V.O.)

    I've been searching for you for a very, very long time. (looks at Spike) Ever 
    since you killed my mother.

    against the wall.

  BUFFY
    You try anything again, he'll kill you. (Robin laughs) More importantly, I'll 
    let him. (Robin looks at Buffy)

    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

  PROLOGUE:
  23     EXT.     WOODS 
    - NIGHT
    A teenage girl is running through the woods at night, running for her life. 
    Bringers are chasing her. She sees an old pick-up truck driving down a dirt 
    road through the woods, and she runs in front of it, waving it down emphatically 
    with both arms. 
  GIRL
    Stop! Stop! Stop, please! (the driver slows and stops the truck; the girl 
    goes to the passenger door and speaks to him through the open window)
  MAN
    (wearing a black shirt with priest's collar, speaking in a southern drawl) 
    What's goin' on?
  GIRL
    Please get me out of here! (opens the passenger door and climbs in)
  MAN
    Was someone hurt? What is it?
  GIRL
    (shuts door) Drive.
  Cut to:
  24     INT.     TRUCK 
    - NIGHT
    The young girl is panting, catching her breath. She's sitting in the passenger's 
    seat in an old truck beside a man dressed as a preacher or priest.
  MAN
    Well, that was, uh... Are you all right?
  GIRL
    (panting) Thank you. Thank God you were there.
  MAN
    Well, let's not give him credit for everything. (smiles) No, I'm funning you. 
    I don't believe it was a coincidence. I also don't believe young girls should 
    be out in the woods late at night—should be tucked in bed.
  GIRL
    (softly) Wish I was.
  MAN
    I expect you do at that. Look, I don't mean to pry, but those boys... they 
    looked like— Well, you didn't happen to fall in with devil worshipers, 
    did you? (the girl doesn't answer, just stares out the window) Na, I'm—I'm 
    sorry. You, uh, you look like you've been traveling a while. I didn't think 
    that— Is there some place you'd like me to drop you? You heading some 
    place?
  GIRL
    Sunnydale.
  MAN
    I'm going there myself. I ain't never been, but I expect we could find a police 
    station or a—
  GIRL
    I just need to get to Revello Drive. (the man nods) Um, thanks, Father...
  MAN / CALEB
    Call me Caleb. Never was nobody's daddy.
  GIRL / SHANNON
    I'm Shannon.
  CALEB
    Well, Shannon, you feel like telling me why those Freaky Joe's were after 
    you?
  SHANNON
    I'm not sure.
  CALEB
    Well, do you ever think that maybe they were chasing you because you're a 
    whore?
  SHANNON
    (looks at Caleb, scoffs) What?
  CALEB
    Now, I know what you're thinking. Crazy preacher man spoutin' off at the mouth 
    about the whore of Babylon or some-such. That ain't me. I'm not here to lecture 
    you. I mean, what's the point? (presses in his dashboard cigarette lighter) 
    My words just curdle in your ears. Wouldn't take in a thing. (Shannon looks 
    around nervously, looks out the window) Head's filled with so much filth that 
    ain't no room for words of truth. Well, you know what you are, Shannon? Dirty.
  SHANNON
    (offended) What? I'm not! What're—
  CALEB
    Now, now, now. There's no blame here. You were born dirty, born without a 
    soul. Born with that gaping maw wants to open up, suck out a man's marrow. 
    Makes me puke to think too hard on it. (Shannon touches the passenger side 
    door, trying to open it, but there's no handle) Yeah, that there door's problematical. 
    I don't know as I could recommend steppin' out at this speed anyway. You're 
    like as not to tumble some. But, of course, there's my boys back there—Ooh, 
    they hate to miss a mark.
  SHANNON
    (shocked) Your boys?
  CALEB
    Well, they ain't exactly my "blue eyed boys" but they're hard workers. 
    And they don't truck with Satan—that was just me having fun. (looks at 
    Shannon) Satan is a little man. (Shannon reaches for the steering wheel, but 
    he pushes her away, pinning her against the seat, then shakes his finger at 
    her) I don't like back-seat drivers.
  Caleb reaches to the dashboard and grabs the cigarette lighter. He places 
    the heated coil of the lighter on a ring he's wearing on the middle finger 
    of his right hand and presses it for a moment.
  SHANNON
    (sees what Caleb's doing, and cowers) Please...don't hurt me.
  CALEB
    Well, now, is this the part where you offer to do anything? Because I tried 
    to make it clear—you got nothin' I want to explore. 
  Caleb puts the lighter back in the dashboard and presses his heated ring 
    into Shannon's neck, making a sizzling sound. Shannon screams.
  CALEB
    Oh yeah. That's it! That's a cleansing fire. Hallelujah! Now, if I'm not mistaken, 
    there's a car a little ways behind us, and I do believe there's some folk 
    in it goin' the same place you are. Now, I want you to deliver a message for 
    me, but it's not for them. It's for the other one—the one and only, the 
    original, accept-no-substitutes slayer. Would you tell her something for me?
  SHANNON
    (frightened) Yes.
  CALEB
    Thank you, Shannon. (takes a knife and stabs Shannon in the stomach, then 
    whispers something in her ear) Now, let's see what we can't do about that 
    door. 
  Caleb kicks the door open and pushes Shannon out.

  25     EXT.     RURAL 
    HIGHWAY - NIGHT
    Shannon falls out of the pick-up truck and rolls across the pavement. A car 
    driving toward her slams on its breaks. The driver, Willow, steps out and 
    runs to the girl's side. The passenger steps out of the car and saunters toward 
    Shannon.
  WILLOW
    (to Shannon) Are you OK? Can you hear me? (rolls Shannon over) Can you talk? 
    (to her passenger) This girl's bleeding badly. We have to get her to the hospital.
  As Willow's passenger walks forward into the light, show it's Faith standing 
    there.
  FAITH
    (unfazed) Yep. Guess I'm back in Sunnydale.

  Opening Credits.
  ACT I:
  26     INT.     XANDER'S 
    APARTMENT - NIGHT
    Xander's floor is covered with sleeping bags and potentials. In his bedroom, 
    he's under the blanket in his bed, and one of the potentials is sitting on 
    his bed in skimpy pajamas, chatting.
  XANDER
    I know it's hard.
  POTENTIAL
    I haven't been able to sleep the last few nights.
  XANDER
    Hey, listen. It's gonna be OK. Buffy knows what she's doing. She's not gonna 
    send you into battle until she's sure you're ready for action. (nods)
  POTENTIAL
    That's just it, though. How will I know I'm ready...for action?
  XANDER
    You have to trust us.
  POTENTIAL
    I'm so scared, Xander. I'm so young. (looks into Xander's eyes)
  XANDER
    Well, believe it or not, I was younger than you when I started all this.
  POTENTIAL
    There's just so much I haven't done, so much I need to do. It's like... I 
    never had a real boyfriend, you know?
  XANDER
    Yeah?
  POTENTIAL
    (coyly) I've never been with a man. I could die tomorrow, and I've never been 
    with a man.
  XANDER
    Well, uh—
  Another girl appears sitting on the bed beside the first potential. 
  POTENTIAL 2
    I've never been with a man before either.
  XANDER
    (smiles) Colleen.
  POTENTIAL 2 / COLLEEN
    I've never been with her in front of a man before.
  POTENTIAL
    I've never been with her in front of a man, either.
  XANDER
    Um...
  POTENTIAL
    (both girls crawl toward Xander seductively) Xander...
  XANDER
    We can't.
  COLLEEN
    We're so scared. (the first potential nods)
  XANDER
    The others might hear us.
  COLLEEN
    (shakes head) No, they won't.
  POTENTIAL
    (shakes head) They're OK.
  The door to Xander's room opens to reveal a living room full of girls 
    pillow-fighting in their skimpy pajamas. The air is filled with feathers.
  RONA (O.S.)
    Xander!
  Cut to:
  27     INT.     XANDER'S 
    APARTMENT - NIGHT
    Xander is startled awake in his bedroom by Rona's insistent calls. There's 
    three other girls standing in the doorway wearing decent (not skimpy) pajamas, 
    glaring at Xander with their arms crossed. 
  RONA
    Xander!
  XANDER
    Wha—?
  RONA
    (sighs) God damn it!
  XANDER
    What's going on? I was sleeping.
  RONA
    (irritated) Dominique has the stomach flu, and the toilet bowl is backed up.
  XANDER
    (smiles nervously) I'll be right out. (takes one of his hands out from under 
    the covers) Got, uh, a leg cramp.
  Rona nods and walks out, shutting the door behind her. Xander leans his 
    head back on the pillow and rolls his eyes.
  Cut to:
  28     INT.     SUNNYDALE 
    HOSPITAL - NIGHT
    Looking through a wall of windows, Willow and Faith are watching surgeons 
    operate on someone.
  FAITH
    You sure she's one of us? She don't look like much now. Not a potential slayer, 
    I mean.
  WILLOW
    Don't know. Seems to fit, though. We'll know more when she regains consciousness.
  FAITH
    (scoffs) If she regains consciousness. Girl's been gutted like a catfish.
  WILLOW
    Yeah.
  FAITH
    (looks at Willow) Something's killing girls all over the world, trying to 
    end the slayer line. Thing like that, figure I might get a heads up.
  WILLOW
    (drops her hands to her side, shakes her head) Faith...
  FAITH
    (throws up her hands) Guess it doesn't really matter as long as you got the 
    true slayer intact.
  WILLOW
    You were in prison. Figured you were safe there.
  FAITH
    (scoffs) Yeah, that's prison. Safe as a kitten.
  WILLOW
    Sorry, I... don't know much about the big house. Was it— (Faith looks 
    away) I mean, did something happen in there?
  FAITH
    (looks at Willow) Someone came at me with a nasty looking knife. Didn't really 
    know why 'til now.
  WILLOW
    Oh, Faith, we didn't—
  FAITH
    Forget it. It's cool. I get by. (gestures to the patient being operated on) 
    What're we gonna do about her?
  WILLOW
    Uh, I guess we should find Buffy, tell her what's going on. I-I tried calling 
    home. Dawn says she's out patrolling.
  FAITH
    Let's go look for her. (walks away) Cemetery's more fun anyway. 
  WILLOW
    Wait, somebody should wait here in case she wakes up.
  FAITH
    (stops walking) Fine, sit tight. I'll be back. (walks away)
  WILLOW
    W-w-wait. Uh, maybe you meeting Buffy alone isn't the best idea.
  FAITH
    (turns around) You told her the sitch, right? She knows I'm coming. Probably 
    been up all night hanging streamers. (grins sarcastically)
  WILLOW
    Yeah, but it's not like you're study buddies, exactly. Maybe it'd be better 
    if I...eased her into the whole thing.
  FAITH
    I can't stay here, Willow. Spent way too much time in hospitals. We don't 
    click. Don't worry. (grins) I'm sure we'll all get along just fine. (turns, 
    walks away)
  Cut to:
  29     EXT.     CEMETERY 
    IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT
    A blonde young woman is running at top speed through the cemetery. Someone's 
    pursuing her. She stops running and looks for a place to hide. Someone punches 
    her, knocking her down to the ground. Her pursuer kneels down to grab the 
    young woman, but someone picks him up and throws him into a nearby tombstone. 
    It was Spike who was pursuing the young woman, and Faith who pulled him off 
    of her.
  FAITH
    Whatcha wanna do to her, vamp? (circles Spike) Huh? Somthin' like this? (punches 
    Spike) 
  SPIKE
    (stands) Nice punch you got there. Lemme guess. Leather pants, nice right 
    cross, doe eyes, holier-than-thou glower...you must be Faith.
  FAITH
    (shrugs and grins) Oh, goodie. I'm famous.
  SPIKE
    Told you were coming. Bit of a misunderstanding here. I'm—
  FAITH
    Spike. (nods) Yeah, we've met before.
  SPIKE
    We have? I don't think we— (Faith kicks Spike in the torso) Bloody hell! 
    What're you doing? I'm on your side.
  FAITH
    Yeah? Maybe you haven't heard. I've reformed. (punches Spike)
  SPIKE
    So have I. (punches Faith) I reformed way before you did. (Faith punches Spike) 
    Stop... (punches Faith) hitting... (punches Faith again) me! We're on the 
    same side.
  FAITH
    Please. You think I'm stupid?
  SPIKE
    Well, yeah. (grins) 
  FAITH
    You were attacking that girl. (punches Spike)
  Someone punches Faith in the face, knocking her down. Pan over to show 
    it's Buffy.
  BUFFY
    (innocently) Sorry, Faith. I didn't realize that was you.
  FAITH
    It's all right, B. Luckily, you still punch like you used to. 
  BUFFY
    (glares at Faith a moment, then turns to Spike) You OK?
  SPIKE
    Yeah. Terrific.
  FAITH
    (shocked) Are you protecting vampires? Are you the bad slayer now? Am I the 
    good slayer now?
  BUFFY
    He's with me. He has a soul.
  FAITH
    Oh, he's like Angel?
  SPIKE
    No.
  BUFFY
    Sort of.
  SPIKE
    I am nothing like Angel.
  BUFFY
    He fights on my side. (shrugs, looks at Faith) Which is more than I can say 
    for some of us.
  FAITH
    Yeah, well if he's so good, what's he doing chasing down defenseless—
  The young woman that Spike was chasing stands up, growls, and attacks 
    Faith, knocking her down.
  BUFFY
    (points to the young woman) That's one of the bad guys.
  FAITH
    You should make 'em wear a sign. (the young woman is a vampire; Faith fights 
    the vamp woman, and reaches around to Buffy's pocket full of stakes) May I? 
    (takes a stake) Thanks.
  Faith continues fighting the vamp woman, then stakes her.
  SPIKE
    Angel's dull as a table lamp. And we have very different coloring.
  FAITH
    OK, catching up. Anything else I gotta know?
  BUFFY
    Nice to have you back.

  30     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    HOUSE - NIGHT
    Buffy, Faith, and Spike walk into Buffy's house through the front door. Dawn 
    and Giles are at the dining room table.
  FAITH
    Whoa. Memory Lane. Same old house.
  BUFFY
    Yeah, well, every piece of furniture's been destroyed and replaced since you 
    left, so, actually, new house.
  DAWN
    (stands, walks toward them with her arms crossed) Buffy? (looks disapprovingly 
    at Faith)
  BUFFY
    We have a new house guest.
  FAITH
    Hey, got a spare bed for a wanted fugitive?
  GILES
    (stands, nods) Hello, Faith.
  FAITH
    Well, I guess "wanted" wasn't really accurate.
  DAWN
    Does she have to stay here? Because there's some nice hotels that welcome 
    tried-to-kill-your-sister types.
  FAITH
    (smiles) Check it out. Brat's all woman-sized.
  BUFFY
    Look, I need to get to the hospital. Some girl was attacked on her way into 
    town. We think she might be a—
  DAWN
    We know. Willow's been calling. 
  GILES
    She's still there. She's gonna call if the girl wakes up.
  BUFFY
    (glares at Giles) Fine. (walks out of the room)
  GILES
    Well, Faith, we better, um, see if we can find some place to squeeze you in 
    for the night. (Giles and Dawn walk away)
  SPIKE
    Not all that tension was about you. Giles was a part of a plan to kill me...for 
    Buffy's own good.
  FAITH
    Well, that makes me feel better about me, worse about Giles...kinda shaky 
    about you.

    Caleb pours wine into a glass directly from a barrel.
  CALEB
    "Drink of this, for it is my blood." (drinks) You know, I always 
    loved the story of the Last Supper. (looks at his glass, turns, paces) The 
    body and blood of Christ becoming rich, red wine. I recall, as a boy, though, 
    I couldn't help but think: what would happen if you were at the Last Supper, 
    and you ordered the white? A nice oaky Chardonnay or White Zin... I mean, 
    would he make that out of his lymph or some-all? (shrugs) Never did bring 
    it up. Suppose there was a reason why I never spent too long in one parish. 
    Just looking for answers. Just looking for the Lord in the wrong damn places. 
    (gestures to someone in the room with him) Then you showed me the light.
  BUFFY/FIRST (O.S.)
    Do you think I'm God? (walks out from the shadows toward Caleb)
  CALEB
    I certainly do not. I am beyond concepts like that.
  BUFFY/FIRST
    But you still wear the outfit.
  CALEB
    Man can't turn his back on what he come from. Besides, black is slimming. 
    (looks at his outfit) Everyone knows that.
  BUFFY/FIRST
    How do you like what I'm wearing?
  CALEB
    Just another dirty girl. And, since you only dress up in dead folk, I'm guessing, 
    one who's already been paid her wage.
  BUFFY/FIRST
    Look hard. What do you see?
  CALEB
    (checks out the First's form) Strength. And the loneliness that comes with 
    real strength.
  BUFFY/FIRST
    Nothing about my pert and bouncy hairdo?
  CALEB
    You're her. 
  BUFFY/FIRST
    The slayer.
  CALEB
    (reaches toward her) At long last. (tries to touch her face, but his hand 
    goes through her head) All this time. All the work I've done for you... Blowing 
    up the Council, organizing the Ray Charles Brigade, and stickin' all them 
    splits—you never showed me.
  BUFFY/FIRST
    Well, you've earned it. And you'll be meeting her soon. Am I right?
  CALEB
    Oh, yeah. Yeah, she'll get the message.
  BUFFY/FIRST
    And what makes you so sure she'll come?
  CALEB
    (points, nods) Curiosity. Woman's first sin. I offer her an apple. What can 
    she do but take it? (grins, gestures "cheers" with his glass) I'll 
    see you soon.

    of potentials.
  AMANDA
    What the hell are you talking about? I thought Faith killed a volcanologist.
  ANDREW
    (laughs, lets Rona go, puts down the knife) Silly, silly...Amanda. Why would 
    Faith kill a person who studies Vulcans?
  AMANDA
    He studied volcanoes. He was a professor.
  ANDREW
    Ah, yes. Well, regardless...
  MOLLY
    I thought you weren't supposed to be doing this anymore—making up stories.
  ANDREW
    I'm not. This is true. Except for that...possible...word misunderstanding. 
    (sighs) They're the things you need to know about. (looks out the window at 
    Faith working out in the back yard) Faith...has a history not to be taken 
    lightly. (turns to face the girls) She's a killer. Never forget that. You 
    must stay on guard around Faith at all times. Your very lives may depend on 
    it.

  BUFFY
    You look better.
  ROBIN WOOD
    (without looking up) No, I don't.
  BUFFY
    (smiles) No, you don't.
  ROBIN WOOD
    But I'll be OK. Unless, of course, you start beating up on me now.
  BUFFY
    I won't. (shrugs) Well, I thought about it. I made some doodles. As far as 
    I'm concerned, we're on even ground. I meant what I said. I don't have time 
    for your vendetta, but I need you in this fight. I want you on my side.
  ROBIN WOOD
    Thanks. That means a lot.
  BUFFY
    So, we're good?
  ROBIN WOOD
    (looks at Buffy) Absolutely. (Buffy sighs) You're fired.
  BUFFY
    (shocked) What?
  ROBIN WOOD
    Effective immediately.
  BUFFY
    You're firing me? (walks into his office, stands in front of his desk) I just 
    refrained from kicking your ass.
  ROBIN WOOD
    Buffy, there's nothing here for you. I mean, people are leaving town, half 
    the kids don't even bother showing up anymore. You've got things to deal with 
    that are much worse than anything here. Look at the big picture.
  BUFFY
    Right. (sits) The big picture. The one with the big war and the dead little 
    girls.
  ROBIN WOOD
    Not dead. Not dead. Not if you get them ready.
  BUFFY
    I don't want to lead them into war. It can't be the right thing.
  ROBIN WOOD
    Most wars aren't, you know.
  BUFFY
    Some of these girl haven't even been tested in battle.
  ROBIN WOOD
    Then, I guess, maybe you should test them.
  BUFFY
    (suddenly chipper) Couldn't I just come to work part-time? I could make flyers 
    for encounter groups and post them up all over school.
  ROBIN WOOD
    And you're fired again. (looks down) Remember, Buffy, the mission's what matters.

    Faith walks into the basement and sits down on the stairs. The sounds of girls 
    chattering can be heard through the basement door she left open. Faith sighs, 
    takes out a cigarette, and lights up.
  SPIKE
    (sitting on his cot with his shirt off) You craving a moment alone in the 
    dank, or can I bum one?
  FAITH
    (smiles, stands) Well, I guess you can smoke all you want—the big C not 
    really an issue. (hands her cigarette to Spike) 
  SPIKE
    Teeth get yellow after an eternity. Gotta watch that.
  FAITH
    (takes out another cigarette for herself) Huh. (looks at the chains and shackles 
    on the wall behind Spike's cot)
  SPIKE
    (looks over at the chains) Right. Not what it looks like. 
  FAITH
    Hey, to each his own, man. This one guy I ran with, he liked me to dress up 
    like a school girl and take this friggin' bull-whip, (gestures like she's 
    using a whip) and I'd be like—
  SPIKE
    I got dangerous...for a while. 
  FAITH
    This before the soul, or after?
  SPIKE
    After, but I got over it—in case you're feeling all dust-happy again 
    after your long incarceration.
  FAITH
    (smiles) Not if you're all repenty. Takes the fun out of it. (the girls upstairs 
    are making noise) No more Starbucks for the wannabe's man. They've been spazzing 
    for, like, hours.
  SPIKE
    Yeah, does get a bit much up there.
  FAITH
    They're good girls. Just green is all.
  SPIKE
    So, why aren't you up there...imparting?
  FAITH
    That's Buffy's thing. Anyway, I just spent a good stretch of time locked away 
    with a mess of female-types. Kinda had my fill.
  SPIKE
    Hm. But you waited until Angel needed your help to bust out of jail.
  FAITH
    Three squares, nice weight room, movie every third Sunday. Could've been worse.
  SPIKE
    What movie?
  FAITH
    Last one was Glitter. (Spike raises an eyebrow at her) I guess it couldn't 
    have been worse.
  SPIKE
    You had the power to walk away anytime. Nothing to stop you.
  FAITH
    I stopped me. I got dangerous for a while. (takes off her jacket)
  SPIKE
    You over it?
  FAITH
    (stretches her arms) More or less. I pull for the good guys now.
  SPIKE
    What's the less?
  FAITH
    (grins coyly) The usual stuff...
  SPIKE
    Such as?
  FAITH
    (grins) I was thinking about looking up the guy with the bull-whip. Long incarceration.
  SPIKE
    (chuckles) You could do better. School girl thing's old hat.
  FAITH
    It's all old-hat, man. (shrugs) Every guy's got some whack fantasy. Scratch 
    the surface of any granola-type dude—naughty nurses and horny cheerleaders. 
    (shrugs) I figure, if you can't beat 'em—
  SPIKE
    Join 'em.
  FAITH
    Just don't forget who's on top.
  SPIKE
    That, I suspect, would be you.
  FAITH
    (grins) You got that right. (walks over to Spike's cot, sits beside him) I've 
    met you before, you know.
  SPIKE
    Yeah, you made a great impression on my chin.
  FAITH
    Not in the graveyard. Before that. I was kinda wearing a different body.
  SPIKE
    Pity.
  FAITH
    You seemed OK with it.
  SPIKE
    The body swap. (nods) With Buffy. 
  FAITH
    She fill you in on that whole deal?
  SPIKE
    She told me it went down. Failed to mention who was driving her skin around.
  FAITH
    I may have said a few things...
  SPIKE
    (looks into Faith's eyes) Like you could ride me at a gallop 'til my knees 
    buckle, squeeze me 'til I pop like warm champagne. That's not the kind of 
    thing a man forgets.
  FAITH
    Should've known it wasn't blondie behind the wheel. She'd never throw down 
    like that.
  SPIKE
    Oh, you have been away. (Spike chuckles) 
  FAITH
    Don't even tell me little Miss Tightly-Wound's been getting her naughty on?
  SPIKE
    Not of late.
  FAITH
    Wow. Everybody's just full of surprises. (Buffy walks down the steps into 
    the basement, stares at Spike and Faith) Hey, B.
  BUFFY
    (crosses her arms) Well, it's nice to see you two getting along so well.
  FAITH
    Yeah. Uh, you just know all the cool vampires. (sits forward)
  BUFFY
    Yeah.
  SPIKE
    Hey, aren't you usually at work 'bout now?
  BUFFY
    I kind of decided to cut back on my hours.
  DAWN (O.S.)
    Buffy? Is that you?
  BUFFY
    (yells back to Dawn) Down here. (to Spike) Figured I'd be better off focusing 
    on what's going on around here.

  Pan over to show Buffy and Willow standing beside her bed.
  BUFFY
    He—he picked you up on the side of the road?
  SHANNON
    Bringers were chasing me. He said they were his boys...right before he burned 
    me.
  Shannon removes the bandage over the burn on her neck. Willow takes a 
    digital camera out of her purse and snaps a picture of the burn.
  SHANNON
    He wanted to tell you something. Before he...cut me...he told me to give the

    Looks like he's working for the First. He's taunting us, calling us out. Says 
    he's got something of mine. Could be another girl, could be something else. 
    Don't know, don't care. I'm tired of talking. I'm tired of training. He's

  HELPLESS GIRL
    Oh. (smiles sweetly) You. I was looking for you.
  CALEB
    Is that right?
  HELPLESS GIRL
    I heard you speakin' tonight. Preachin'. I felt your words go straight to 
    me.
  CALEB
    Well, the truth is like a sword, isn't it, girl? Cuts deep.
  HELPLESS GIRL
    (smiles) Yeah.
  CALEB
    The words I use got a power to them. (paces) A power, now. They're not just 
    words—they're truth.
  HELPLESS GIRL
    (leans back against a wine barrel) They brought me here.
  CALEB
    They called you. You know why? Because you're human. (walks around her) You 
    got your urges. A woman's got hers. A man's got his. Our whole race can be 
    do damnably weak... (walks back toward the shadow) That's why we seek the 
    strength, the power. 
  HELPLESS GIRL
    It's not wrong to be drawn to the power, is it, preacher? (follows him into 
    the shadow)
  CALEB
    Oh, no, child. It's not wrong... (the girl gasps and falls to the ground, 
    revealing a bloody stomach wound) Just human.
  The girl's body transforms into Buffy's form.
  BUFFY/FIRST
    (stands) Most people don't like visits from their dead, you know.
  CALEB
    Heathens. No appreciations for life's pleasures. Do it again.
  BUFFY/FIRST
    I take requests. (crosses arms) One of those potentials you killed, perhaps?
  CALEB
    No, save them for later. I'm in more of an old memory lane kind of mood. Back 
    before I met you, there was this choir girl in Knoxville I used to give singing 
    lessons to...why, she even screamed on key. Show me her.
  BUFFY/FIRST
    (shakes her head) All these girls...they followed you willingly. You tricked 
    them.

  WILLOW
    We don't even know where we're going.
  BUFFY
    'S why I figured we'd do a little recon first. (to Faith) You up for it?
  FAITH
    Point me where you want me. 
  GILES
    And you're certain this is the best course of action? You don't even know 
    what this man has of yours—if he, in fact, has anything.
  BUFFY
    It could be a girl, a potential trying to get to us.
  GILES
    Could be a stapler.
  BUFFY
    Going in anyway.
  GILES
    With the girls? Most of whom have yet to be in the field, let alone in a life 
    or death situation.
  BUFFY
    Then it's time we test them. Look, I'll just take the ones that have been 
    here the longest. The rest can stay behind.
  SPIKE
    Could be that's just what he wants you to do—the old bait-and-switch.
  WILLOW
    Yeah, he lures us away and then kills the girls we leave behind.
  BUFFY
    I know. That's why I need you to stay here with them. You're my most powerful 
    weapon, Will. I know you can keep them safe if anything happens.
  XANDER
    An unknown man breezes into town, says he has something of yours. Buffy, this 
    thing's got "trap" written all over it.
  BUFFY
    He won't be expecting a full attack—not this soon, (emphatically) that's 
    why we have to move.
  GILES
    We know nothing about this man. We cannot go into battle unprepared. We have 
    to have more time.
  BUFFY

  BUFFY
    Or something, I guess. Pretty good when they attack.
  FAITH
    Do they just roam free around town?
  BUFFY
    Well, normally, they show up out of nowhere, and then either stab or get stabbed, 
    and then they run off. Looks like this guy wants to be found.
  FAITH
    Lends weight to the whole "it's a trap" theory.
  BUFFY
    (snappily) I'm through waiting around for people to attack us.
  FAITH
    Hey, I'm with you. Drop me in the hornet's nest, what the hell? You got a 
    rough sitch here, trying to turn a bunch of little girls into an army...
  BUFFY
    They're potential slayers, just like we were. 
  FAITH
    Right. Maybe they'll do as good as us.
  BUFFY
    They're getting better.
  FAITH
    I'll work with 'em. Some of 'em seem real eager. Fashion disasters, yeah, 
    but they're ready to fight.
  BUFFY
    (stops walking) Why did you come back? 
  FAITH
    Willow said you needed me. Didn't give it a lot of thought. Do you—Am 
    I getting you want me to be not here?
  BUFFY
    (sighs) No, that's not what I meant. I'm...glad that you're here. It's good. 
    Thank you. (walks)
  FAITH
    No problem. You know me. All about the good deeds.
  BUFFY
    Willow said you helped out Angel.
  FAITH
    Yeah. He says "Hi."
  BUFFY
    Really.
  FAITH
    Sure.
  BUFFY
    How is he?
  FAITH
    Better. Had to do this whole magical mind-walk with him.
  BUFFY
    You were in Angel's mind?
  FAITH
    Buffy... (stops, looks at the barn-like building that the Bringer walked up 
    to) What is this place?

  XANDER
    Now remember, we're looking for killing blows only, people. (hands bat to 
    Rona) So, chest and throat if it's a vampire. Stomach, chest and face if it's 
    a Bringer.
  RONA
    What if it's something else?
  XANDER
    Could happen. Something other-worldly. And here's a handy rule: don't go for 
    the flashy tentacles just because they're waving 'em about trying to get attention. 
    Go for the center— (points to each) brains, heart, eyes. Everything's 
    got eyes.
  DAWN
    Except the Bringers.
  XANDER
    Except the Bringers.
  MOLLY
    I don't want there to be tentacles. I'm not good with squishy.
  KENNEDY
    I don't care if it's Godzilla. (raises a huge sword) I want to get in this 
    thing.
  ANDREW
    Godzilla's mostly Tokyo-based, so he's probably a no-show.
  AMANDA
    Besides, if Matthew Broderick can kill Godzilla, how tough is he?
  ANDREW
    (whines) Xander... (crosses his arms petulantly)
  XANDER
    Matthew Broderick did not kill Godzilla. He killed a big, dumb lizard. That 
    was not the real Godzilla.
  RONA
    You people are even crazier than her.
  XANDER
    Than who?
  RONA
    Buffy, man. I mean, taking us right into the bad guy's lair.
  XANDER
    Well, that's where, generally speaking, you'd go to find the bad guy. And 
    I don't think you came here to fight plaque.
  RONA
    No, I came here for protection.
  XANDER
    Well, you signed on to fight with—
  RONA
    Look, I know, but... (sighs) this plan is trouble. OK, Buffy doesn't care 
    how many of us she puts in danger—
  XANDER
    Let me tell you something about Buffy. In fact, you should all listen to this.
  KENNEDY
    Uh, we kinda were.
  XANDER
    I've been through more battles with Buffy than you all can ever imagine. She's 
    stopped everything that's ever come up against her. (Buffy and Faith walk 
    through the front door and overhear Xander's speech) She's laid down her life—literally—to 
    protect the people around her. This girl has died two times, and she's still 
    standing. You're scared? That's smart. You got questions? You should. But 
    you doubt her motives, you think Buffy's all about the kill, then you take 
    the little bus to battle. (Buffy tears up) I've seen her heart, and this time—not 
    literally. And I'm telling you, right now, she cares more about your lives 
    than you will ever know. You gotta trust her. She's earned it.
  Andrew and Dawn are crying.
  FAITH
    Damn. I never knew you were that cool. (everyone turns to look at Buffy and 
    Faith) 
  BUFFY
    Well, you always were a little slow.
  FAITH
    I get that now.
  BUFFY
    All right, let's saddle up.
  Cut to:
  42     EXT.     SH. 
    VALLEY VINEYARDS - NIGHT
    Buffy's brought a small gang with her to the vineyard—Faith, Spike, Xander, 
    Kennedy, Rona, Molly, Chao-Ahn, Amanda and another potential. They walk up 
    to the front door, then Buffy pauses to address the team.
  BUFFY
    OK. Set up a perimeter. Guard the door. I don't want anything getting in behind 
    us. My team goes in first, we check the place out. You guys are our safety-net. 
    If this place is a trap, we give the signal, you guys come in, guns a-blazing.
  XANDER
    So, what's the signal?
  BUFFY
    I'm thinking lots and lots of yelling.
  XANDER
    Got it.
  BUFFY
    Shall we?
  Buffy leads a subset of the team inside.
  Cut to:
  43     INT.     WINE 
    CELLAR AT THE SHADOW VALLEY VINEYARDS - NIGHT
    Buffy walks down the steps into the wine cellar, followed by Molly, Kennedy, 
    Rona and Chao-Ahn.
  MOLLY
    (looking around) What is this place?
  BUFFY
    Looks like an old vineyard.
  KENNEDY
    An evil vineyard, huh?
  SPIKE
    Like Falcon Crest.
  BUFFY
    (looking in the shadows) Stay alert, you guys. Bringers are here somewhere. 
    Just need to find out where.
  SPIKE
    Shouldn't be too hard.
  Bringers come out of the shadows, from behind the barrels of wine, and 
    attack Buffy and gang. The fight is fairly even. Suddenly, the Bringers stop 
    fighting and walk back into the shadows. Caleb walks out into the light.
  CALEB
    Well, now, you girls are just burning with righteousness, aren't you? Problem 
    is, you think you're blazing like suns, when really you're burning like matchsticks 
    in the face of the darkness. You having fun? Now, I hope my boys haven't worn 
    you out too much—I need you fit for when I purify you.
  BUFFY
    Save the sermon, padre. I heard you have something of mine.
  CALEB
    (chuckles) Well, I do now. You liked my little message, did you? You know, 
    I ruined a perfectly good knife on that girl. Got her soiled blood all over 
    the place. I may have to get a new truck. (Buffy looks taken aback) So, you're 
    the slayer. The slayer. The strongest, the fastest, the most aflame with that 
    most precious invention of all mankind—the notion of goodness. The slayer 
    must indeed be powerful. (with one powerful punch, he sends Buffy flying across 
    the room) So, what else you got? (looks around smugly)
  Fade to black.
  ACT IV:
  44     INT.     WINE 
    CELLAR AT THE SHADOW VALLEY VINEYARDS - NIGHT
    Resume. Caleb has knocked Buffy across the room.
  Spike vamps out and attacks Caleb. Caleb pushes him down with ease. Spike 
    tries to get up, but Caleb head-butts him, then throws him across the room 
    into a huge wine storage tank that busts when Spike hits it. Wine pours out 
    of the tank and washes Spike across the floor. Kennedy and the other potentials 
    get into gear and join the fight.
  KENNEDY
    Let's go!
  The Bringers come back out of the shadows to fight the potentials as well. 
    Kennedy storms Caleb but has to engage a Bringer instead. Caleb punches Kennedy, 
    knocking her into a stack of wine barrels.
  RONA
    (worried) Kennedy!
  Rona runs toward Kennedy, but Caleb cuts her off. She swings the spiked 
    baseball bat at Caleb, but he catches it and looks her in the eyes.
  CALEB
    (to Rona) Miss, I do believe you have your own problems you should be worrying 
    about.
  Caleb breaks Rona's arm with ease, sending her reeling back in agony. 
    Caleb chuckles and bends to pick up a knife from the floor. He tosses the 
    knife to a nearby Bringer, who swings it back ready to plunge it into Rona's 
    body. An arrow pierces the Bringer's forearm as he rears back. They turn to 
    look, and see Xander standing there with a bow. Faith's there beside him. 
    The Bringer leaves Rona and fights with Xander.
  CALEB
    Oh, good. There's more of you.
  Faith charges at Caleb. Xander sees Buffy lying unconscious against the 
    wall where she fell when Caleb threw her. 
  XANDER
    Buffy!
  Xander runs to Buffy, fighting off Bringers on his way to her side. Holding 
    a knife in each hand, Faith engages Caleb in a fight, but she's not seeming 
    to faze him.
  CALEB
    (looks Faith up and down) Well, you're the other one, aren't you. Your Cain 
    to her Abel. (Faith throws a knife at Caleb) No offense meant to Cain, of 
    course.
  Faith attacks Caleb with her other knife, but he grabs her arm, twists 
    it, and crosses it with her other arm in a fashion such that she can't move, 
    but is looking right at him. He squeezes her hands until she's forced to drop 
    the knife. Faith grunts at him and knees him in the crotch, causing Caleb 
    to let go of her just enough that she can escape his grasp. She backhands 
    him across the face.
  FAITH
    (through gritted teeth) Never was much for the good book.
  Caleb grabs Faith's arm and twists it painfully behind her back, causing 
    her to double over. She falls to her knees as he twists and pulls her arm 
    and walks around to the front of her.
  CALEB
    Oh, it has its moments. Paul had some good stuff, for instance. But overall 
    I find it a tad complicated (slaps Faith). I like to keep things simple. (kicks 
    Faith across the room into a stack of wine barrels) Good folk, bad folk, (a potential with long black hair swings at Caleb, but he grabs her
sword, then her face) clean folk, dirty 
    folk...
  Caleb snaps the potential's neck and drops her to the ground.
  MOLLY
    (seeing Caleb kill the potential) No...!
  CALEB
    Yes. (walks toward Molly)
  Xander is at Buffy's side as she recovers and gets back into the game.
  BUFFY
    (weakly trying to sit up) Xander, get them out of here. We have to retreat. 
    Do it.
  Xander leaves. Caleb walks menacingly toward Molly, who backs up slowly, 
    frozen with fear. She raises her arm back to stab him, but he grabs her wrist, 
    then her neck. Another potential fights a Bringer. A Bringer throws Amanda 
    against a wall and attacks her. Buffy stands just as Caleb squeezes Molly's 
    neck, lifting her off the floor. Buffy tries to go to her, but Bringers keep 
    attacking her, slowing her down.
  CALEB
    (to Molly) What can I say? I work in mysterious ways. (stabs Molly, lets go 
    of her neck, dropping her to the ground) Also some fairly straightforward 
    ones.
  Enraged at seeing what he did to Molly, Buffy rushes Caleb. She fights 
    him more evenly this time, avoiding his punches, and landing a few of her 
    own. She punches him so hard, Caleb is sent flying across the room.
  SPIKE
    (grabs Buffy's arm) We're all leaving.
  Spike pulls Buffy away from the fight. Xander goes to Kennedy's side.
  XANDER
    (to Kennedy) Are you OK? (Kennedy nods) Let's go. Come on. 
  Xander helps Kennedy to her feet. Spike escorts Rona out of the building. 
     
  XANDER
    (waving to the others) Let's go! Come on!
  Caleb grabs Xander and turns him around so he's facing Caleb.
  CALEB
    You're the one who sees everything, aren't you? (rears his hand back in front 
    of Xander's face) Well, let's see what we can't do about that.
  Caleb plunges his thumb into Xander's left eye, gouging it out. Xander 
    screams in agony. Spike charges Caleb, knocking Xander away from Caleb. Xander, 
    bleeding from his eye, stumbles back, falling to the ground in front of wine 
    barrels.
  BUFFY
    (goes to Xander's side) Xander! Come on.
  Buffy and Spike lift Xander to his feet, and carry him out, one supporting 
    each of his arms. Caleb sits up but doesn't pursue them as they walk out. 
    He stands and smiles while watching them leave.
  Cut to:
  45     INT.     SUNNYDALE 
    HOSPITAL - NIGHT
    Buffy walks through the hospital, past the beds of her friends who were hurt 
    tonight. Past Rona and the other potentials, to Xander's bed where Willow 
    sits at his side, holding his hand. 
  CALEB (V.O.)
    Now, it's a simple story. Stop me if you've heard it. I have found and truly 
    believe that there is nothing so bad it cannot be made better with a story. 
  
  Buffy just stares at Xander, his head and his eye bandaged.
  CALEB (V.O.)
    And this one's got a happy ending. 
  Cut to:
  46     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Buffy walks through the living room at her house where a room full of potentials 
    attends to their wounded, including Kennedy. Buffy looks away. Dawn watches 
    Buffy walk out of the room.
  CALEB (V.O.)
    There once was a woman, and she was foul, like all women, for Adam's rib was 
    dirty—just like Adam himself—for what was he, but human. 
  Cut to:
  48     INT.     STREET 
    IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT
    Walking alone, her arms crossed, Buffy walks down a desolate street at night 
    looking forlorn and troubled.
  CALEB (V.O.)
    But this woman, she was filled with darkness, despair, and why? Because she 
    did not know. She could not see. 
  Cut to:
  49     INT.     WINE 
    CELLAR AT THE SHADOW VALLEY VINEYARDS - NIGHT
    Caleb is talking to Buffy/First in the cellar.
  CALEB
    She didn't know the good news, the glory that was coming. That'd be you. For 
    the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours, now and forever. You show 
    up, they'll get in line. 
  Cut to:
  50     INT.     STREET 
    IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT
    Walking alone, her arms crossed, Buffy walks down a desolate street at night 
    looking forlorn and troubled.
  CALEB (V.O.)
    'Cause they followed her. And all they have to do is take one more step, and 
    I'll kill them all. See? I told you it had a happy ending.
