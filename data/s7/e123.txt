REVIEW:

GILES (VO)

Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:

1     EXT.     BUFFY's BACKYARD - DAY

  Warren shoots at Buffy, who is in her backyard with Xander. Meanwhile, while 

  running away, Warren fires a random shot that goes through the upstairs window 

  into Willow and Tara's bedroom. 

Cut to:

2     INT.     WILLOW 

  AND TARA'S BEDROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE- DAY

  Tara is shot and falls to the floor. Blood spatters Willow's shirt.

WILLOW

  Tara? Oh, God!

Willow is grief-stricken. She is holding Tara's dead body, and when she 

  looks up to heaven, her eyes turn red and black with dark magic because of her 

  anger.

Cut to:

3     EXT.     WOODS SOMEWHERE IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT

  Warren is strung up between a pair of trees. He is tied at four points, splayed 

  out like the famous DaVinci diagram. Warren calls for help.

WARREN

  Somebody!

Willow, in full dark magic splendor (black hair, black eyes), motions her 

  hand toward Warren, and with a twist of her wrist, removes his skin. Warren 

  screams in agony.

Cut to:

4     INT.     CAVE UNDERNEATH SUNNYDALE CEMETERY - DAY

  Buffy and Dawn are stuck in a cave and cannot escape. Anya, who has recently 

  returned to demon status, has teleported herself into the cave to update them 

  on the Willow situation.

ANYA

  Things just got worse.

BUFFY

  How worse?

ANYA

  End of the world worse. Willow's going to destroy it.

Cut to:

5     EXT.     DARK TEMPLE ON PACIFIC COAST CLIFF - DAY

  Willow is using her powers to activate a trigger at the temple that will 

  end the world. Xander interferes, and hugs her as she sobs.

XANDER

  I love you

Cut to:

6     INT.     CAVE UNDERNEATH SUNNYDALE CEMETERY - DAY

  Buffy and Dawn have just worked together to defeat an evil force, and Dawn surprised 

  Buffy by holding her own quite nicely. 

BUFFY

  (to Dawn) Things really sucked lately. Things are going to change. And I'm 

  going to be there when it does.

Cut to:

7     INT.     CAVE SOMEWHERE IN AFRICA - NIGHT

  Spike is exhausted and beaten, but demands his prize nontheless. 

SPIKE

  Make me what I was.

DEMON

  We will return your soul.

Spike screams.

The Start Of Episode

  

PROLOGUE

8     EXT.     CITY STREET IN ISTANBUL - NIGHT

TITLE CARD: Istanbul

Turkish music plays. Camera shows the city skyline and closes in on the 

  top of a building, and then to the street. A dark-haired girl is running through 

  the arched hallway, looking over her shoulder and panting from the exertion 

  of running so fast. She slips down an embankment. She's being chased. A man 

  on the street sees her through his front door, and closes it rather than help 

  her. Two people in hooded cloaks are chasing her. After trying various alleys 

  looking for an escape route, she finds herself trapped in a dead-end. She sees 

  a drain pipe next to her and decides to use it to scale the building. The people 

  chasing her grab her foot, but she manages to escape their grip and easily climbs 

  up to the roof. There, another hooded figure is waiting and pushes her off the 

  building. She screams, but she lands on the ground alive, on her back. Two hooded 

  figures hold her down, and she fights back with all her might. A third figure 

  raises an arched, shiny, silver dagger and thrusts down at her.

Cut to:

9     EXT.     SUNNYDALE 

  CEMETERY - NIGHT

  Camera is at ground level, showing a new vampire rising from his grave. 

  He's middle-aged, wearing a suit. Sounds of his struggle to escape his grave 

  persist until he interrupts the girls talking.

BUFFY

  It's about power.

Pan to Buffy talking to someone.

BUFFY

  Who's got it. Who knows how to use it. So...

Tosses a stake to Dawn.

BUFFY

  Who's got the power, Dawn?

DAWN

  (sighs) Well, I've got the stake.

BUFFY

  The stake is not the power.

DAWN

  But he's new. He doesn't know his strength. H-he might not know all those fancy 

  martial arts skills they inevitably seem to pick up.

BUFFY

  Who's got the power?

DAWN

  He does.

BUFFY

  Never forget it. Doesn't matter how well prepped you are or how well armed you 

  are. You're a little girl.



DAWN

  Woman.

BUFFY

  Little woman. 

DAWN

  I'm taller than you.

BUFFY

  He's a vampire, OK? Demon. Preternaturally strong. Skilled with powers no human 

  could possibly ever—

VAMPIRE

  Excuse me. I think I'm stuck.

BUFFY

  You're stuck?

VAMPIRE

  My foot's caught on a root or something, and... I don't even know how I got 

  down there. If you girls could just give me a hand...

DAWN

  Hm. So, he's got the power?

BUFFY

  Zip it.

VAMPIRE

  I really appreciate it. It's just it's so dark, and I don't even know what I'm 

  doing here.

Buffy picks him up by his suit collar and puts him down standing on his 

  feet.

VAMPIRE

  Whoa. Ooh. Thanks. That was a help. Unfortunately it was the last—

Buffy grabs him by the throat. His voice turns scratchy.

VAMPIRE

  —thing you'll ever do.

BUFFY

  Listen up. I'm the slayer. You don't want to get into it with me. You want blood? 

  You can have hers. 

Vampire turns to go after Dawn.

BUFFY

  Power. He's got it. He's going to use it. You don't have it, so — 

Vampire is charging Dawn. She bends and flips him over her back.

BUFFY

  —use that. Perfect.

Dawn stakes him, and thinks she defeated him. But she missed the heart. 

  She gets a panicked look on her face. He pushes Dawn down, gets up and away 

  from her. She tries again to stake him, but he overpowers her and starts to 

  bite her neck.

DAWN

  Buffy!

Buffy grabs the vampire's coat from behind, and he drops Dawn. Buffy fights 

  with swings, kicks, punches, etc. Finally, she grabs a nearby sword, and cuts 

  off his head.

BUFFY

  It's real. It's the only lesson, Dawn. It's always real. Let me see.

She inspects Dawn's neck. There are two puncture wounds where the vampire 

  bit her.

DAWN

  It's nothing, it's just a scrape. Plus, I had a plan the whole time.

BUFFY

  Really?

DAWN

  Yeah, I planned to get killed, come back as a vampire, and bite you.

BUFFY

  You wanted to be trained.

DAWN

  Well, just the next time when you're gonna disa—

BUFFY

  You did pretty well.

DAWN

  I did?

BUFFY

  Yeah.

DAWN

  'Cause, you know, with the whole rolling thing, I was actually using his strength, 

  and it was very tai chi. Plus I nearly got the heart.

BUFFY

  My first time out, I missed the heart too.

DAWN

  No way.

BUFFY

  Just the once.

Buffy walks back to pack up her tools and weapons. They begin walking home. 



DAWN

  Well, the next vampire I meet—

BUFFY

  The next vampire you meet, you run away. I just wish that was all we had to 

  worry about. Vampires, demons... they're nothing compared to what's coming.

DAWN

  I know. I just can't believe it's back.

BUFFY

  Believe me, I thought I was long past it. I guess you never are. Just a few 

  more days 'til it starts. Then we'll never know what's coming next.

Cut to:

10     EXT.     NEW SUNNYDALE 

  HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

  Zoomed in on a large pair of scissors. A man is using them to cut a huge red 

  ribbon. Pan out to a press conference and grand opening ceremony with reporters 

  and city officials standing around.

PRINCIPAL

  It is my great pleasure and privilege to announce the official opening—on 

  the very ground that it first stood upon—of the brand new state of the art 

  Sunnydale High!

Ceremonious clapping.

Opening credits and title sequence.

ACT I.

11     EXT.     ENGLISH 

  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

TITLE CARD: Westbury, England

Giles is riding a horse through the English countryside. Then we see him 

  walking through a field to a tree that Willow is sitting under. She is looking 

  at the ground making an exotic flower grow and bloom.

GILES

  That doesn't belong there.

WILLOW

  No, it doesn't.

GILES

  That's the flora kua alaya. A native of Paraguay, if my botany serves.

WILLOW

  Is there anything you don't know everything about?

GILES

  Synchronized swimming. Complete mystery to me.

Moves closer.

GILES

  Yep. Paraguay. Where does it come from?

WILLOW

  Paraguay.

GILES

  Who brought it through the Earth?

WILLOW

  It's all connected. The root systems, the molecules...the energy. Everything's 

  connected. 

GILES

  You sound like Miss Hartness.

WILLOW

  She's taught me a lot.

GILES

  Then why aren't you in your lesson?

WILLOW

  Sorry.

GILES

  It's alright. She was just—

WILLOW

  —afraid. Yeah, they all are. The coven is—they're the most amazing women 

  I've ever met. But there's this look that they get. Like I'm gonna turn them 

  all into bangers and mash, or something. Which I'm not even really sure what 

  that is.

GILES

  They're cautious. I trust you understand that.

WILLOW

  I don't have that much power, I don't think.

GILES

  Everything's connected. You're connected to a great power, whether you feel 

  it or not.

WILLOW

  Well you should just take it from me.

She gets up and storms off, angry at herself. They walk toward a building.

GILES

  You know we can't. This isn't a hobby or an addiction. It's inside you now, 

  this magic. You're responsible for it.

WILLOW

  Will they always be afraid of me?

GILES

  Maybe. Can you handle it?

WILLOW

  I deserve a lot worse. I killed people, Giles.

They stop and look at each other.

GILES

  I've not forgotten.

WILLOW

  When you brought me here, I thought it was to kill me or to lock me in some 

  mystical dungeon for all eternity or—with the torture. Instead, you go all 

  Dumbledore on me. I'm learning about magic. All about energy and Gaia and root 

  systems.

GILES

  Do you want to be punished?

WILLOW

  I wanna be Willow.

GILES

  You are. In the end, we all are who we are, no matter how much we may appear 

  to have changed.

Cut to:

12     EXT.     IN FRONT 

  OF BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY

  Xander parks his car and walks to Buffy's front door, wearing a suit, carrying 

  a large tube of rolled up papers.

Cut to:

13     INT.     BUFFY'S 

  HOUSE - DAY

  Buffy's getting ready to send Dawn off to her first day of school. She is talking 

  to Dawn, who is still upstairs getting ready.

BUFFY

  Dawn! Xander's here.

DAWN (O.S.)

  Just a minute.

BUFFY

  You're going to be late.

DAWN (O.S.)

  I'm comfortable with that.

Buffy opens the front door to let Xander in.

XANDER

  G'morning!

BUFFY

  (to Dawn) Well, you gotta eat something. I made cereal. 

DAWN (O.S.)

  OK. 

BUFFY

  (to Xander) You're unconscionably spiffy.

Buffy walks into the kitchen. Xander follows.

XANDER

  Client meeting. How exactly do you make cereal?

BUFFY

  Ah, you put the box near the milk. I saw it on the food channel. Want something?

XANDER

  I ate. I'm good. How are you?

BUFFY

  My sister's about to go to the same high school that tried to kill me for three 

  years. I can't change districts, I can't afford private school, and I can't 

  begin to prepare for what could possibly come out of there. So, peachy with 

  a side of keen, that would be me.

XANDER

  Well here's a little something for what ails ya.

Xander gestures with the tube of papers he brought in.

BUFFY

  Mmm. You got the rest.

Xander goes into the dining room. Buffy follows. He lays out the plans for 

  the high school.

XANDER

  Take a look.

DAWN

  Hey. Check out double-O Xander.

BUFFY

  Go. Talk with your mouth full.

XANDER

  I've got two crews working on this diabolical yet lucrative new campus. One 

  here finishing the Science building. And one here, reinforcing the Gym. There 

  are no pentagrams, no secret passageways. Everything's up to code and safe as 

  houses.

BUFFY

  Nothing creepy? Strange? From beyond?

DAWN

  (with her mouth full) Maybe you're just paranoid.

XANDER

  Well, there is one interesting detail. I managed to scare up the plan from 

  the old high school. You remember the very center of Sunnydale's own hell mouth?

Xander puts up new and old plans to the window so they can see through them.

BUFFY

  Under the library.

XANDER

  Right. So I lined up the plans, new and old. And right exactly where the library 

  was, we now have...

BUFFY

  Principal's office.

DAWN

  So the principal's evil? 

BUFFY

  Or in a boatload of danger.

XANDER

  Well the last two principals were eaten. Who would even apply for that job?

BUFFY

  Guess we'll see. Ooh, we have to leave though. You have everything? Books, 

  lunch, stakes?

DAWN

  Checked thrice.

XANDER

  (whispering to Buffy) Did you give her the...

BUFFY

  No, I was saving it.

DAWN

  What is it? 

BUFFY

  Back to school gift.

DAWN

  It's a weapon, isn't it?

BUFFY

  Yes, it is.

Dawn begins to open the present, but the camera cuts to the next scene before 

  showing what's inside.

Cut to:

 14     EXT.     IN FRONT 

  OF SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY

  Xander pulls the car up to drop Buffy and Dawn off in front of the school. 

BUFFY

  (to Xander) I'm gonna take her to class, have a look around.

XANDER

  OK. I'm gonna be on-site here all day, so if you have any needs...

Buffy and Dawn get out of the car, and Xander drives off. They walk toward 

  the school's front archway.

BUFFY

  Now, remember, if you see anything strange... or, you know...dead.

DAWN

  I got it

BUFFY

  And stay away from hyena people, or any lizard-type athletes, you know, or 

  if you see anyone that's invisible.

DAWN

  Hey, Buffy, I think it's pretty safe to say I'm not going to see anybody that's 

  invisible.

BUFFY

  You know, you could still drop out. Only nerds finish high school.

DAWN

  You know, I don't really think it's fair for you to try and scare me on my 

  first day of high school. 'Cause it is so redundant.

BUFFY

  The place is evil.

As they enter the archway, someone greets them.

PRINCIPAL

  Tough to let 'em go, huh?

BUFFY

  Hi.

PRINCIPAL

  I'm Robin Wood. New principal.

BUFFY

  Oh, uh, Buffy Summers. This is Dawn.

PRINCIPAL

  Nice to meet you.

DAWN

  Hi.

BUFFY

  So you're the new principal. I expected you to be more... aged.

PRINCIPAL

  Huh. You seem a bit young to have such a gown-up daughter.

BUFFY

  Oh. Uh, uh, no. Sister.

PRINCIPAL

  Oh, right, um, of course.

BUFFY

  You didn't really think she's my... it's my hair. I have mom hair.

DAWN

  No...

PRINCIPAL

  I actually have heard of you, Miss Summers. Graduated from the old high school, 

  am I right?

BUFFY

  Uh, yeah. How did you—?

PRINCIPAL

  Well, I better get back to work. Gotta start deadening young minds. It's really 

  nice to meet you. You have fun.

The principal leaves, and Buffy eyes him carefully as he walks away.

BUFFY

  That was suspicious.

DAWN

  You betcha. Bye.

Dawn walks away from Buffy through the school's courtyard to go to class.

BUFFY

  Oh, Dawn—

DAWN

  I know! You never know what's coming. The stake is not the power. To Serve 

  Man is a cookbook. I love you. Go away.

Buffy crosses her arms, gets an idea, and walks toward the school.

Cut to:

15     INT.     HALLWAYS 

  AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY

  Buffy is walking the halls of the high school while class is in session, checking 

  it out. Suddenly, a basketball is thrown at a locker by a kid who's not in class. 

  She goes to check it out, and sees a kid walk away down another hall out of 

  sight. While following him, Buffy passes a door with a sign that says "Basement. 

  No student access." She continues past it, checking out the halls.

Cut to:

16     INT.     CLASSROOM 

  AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY

  Students are talking to each other before class, but not to Dawn. The teacher 

  gets their attention.

TEACHER

  OK. I'm Mr. Lonegrin. Why don't we go around the room and introduce ourselves, 

  hmm? Let's start with...

Cut to:

17     INT.     RESTROOM 

  AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY

  Buffy walks into the girls' restroom and looks at herself in the mirror, fondling 

  her hair, pouting.

BUFFY

  It's not "mom hair."

  She goes to wash her hands and notices a small bundle of feathers, twigs, 

    crystals, and such bound together with string. She picks it up, and when she 

    looks in the mirror, she sees a girl who wasn't there before. The girl looks 

    dead.

DEAD GIRL

  You can't protect her. You couldn't protect me.

  Buffy turns around, and there's no one there. Then something else comes 

    after her and she backs against the wall.

DEAD JANITOR

  Get out. Get out. Get out!

Buffy looks up again, and he's gone.

Fade to black.

ACT II.

16     INT.     CLASSROOM 

  AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY

  Dawn's classroom again. It's her turn to describe herself to the others.

DAWN

  I love to dance. I like music. I'm very into Britney Spears' early work, 

  before she sold out. So mostly her, um, finger painting and macaroni art. Very 

  underrated. Favorite activities include not ever having to do this again, and 

  uh...

Buffy bursts into the classroom, frantic.

BUFFY

  Dawn!

DAWN

  What?

BUFFY

  We have to go. It's not safe.

DAWN

  But...

BUFFY

  We, um. I mean I saw...

TEACHER

  Can I help you?

BUFFY

  No, I uh. Dawn, I just thought you were, um, in danger... of smoking. I'll 

  be around.

Buffy leaves the classroom.

DAWN

  I also have a sister.

Cut to:

17     INT.     COFFEE 

  SHOP - DAY

  A male/female duet sings for the coffee shop patrons.

DUET

  (singing) You've done for me everything I have ever dreamed. You are a miracle 

  in my eyes? How do I ever say to you...

ANYA

  God, they're depressing.

HALFREK

  Oh, who are they kidding with this happy, shiny crap?

DUET

  (singing) Everyone I have ever...

ANYA

  Six weeks tops and she's calling on me for vengeance.

HALFREK

  (mocking) Oo-ooh, he better run for cover. (laughs)

ANYA

  What's that supposed to mean?

HALFREK

  Oh, sweetie. You know exactly what it means. 

ANYA

  Excuse me?

HALFREK

  It's the talk of the order. They're calling you "Miss Softserve." 

  Tell me you don't know this.

ANYA

  But...who?

HALFREK

  Listen, Anya. I know I've always been a little competitive with you. I mean, 

  there was that thing in the Crimean War. We laugh about it now. But the fact 

  is, I've actually always looked up to you. You were the single-most hard-core 

  vengeance demon on the roster, and everybody knew it. Do I have to mention Mrs. 

  Cholgash?

ANYA

  Hmm. Ha. Good times.

HALFREK

  And then you lost your powers. It happens, and you fell for this Xander guy.

ANYA

  It was a glitch. A summer thing. I am so back in the vengeance fold.

HALFREK

  No deaths. No eviscerations. You're not goading women into anything inventive, 

  and you're not delivering when it is.

ANYA

  I don't even know—

HALFREK

  Waitress downtown wished her husband was a frog? You made him French.

ANYA

  Hmph, he's smelly and with a little mustache. She—

HALFREK

  Listen, Anya, if it was just me—

ANYA

  What do you mean if it was just you?

HALFREK

  D'Hoffrin. The lower beings. They're all feeling the heat. Something's rising. 

  Something older than the old ones, and everybody's tail is twitching. This is 

  a bad time to be a good guy.

ANYA

  Well, what is this—an intervention? Shouldn't all my demon friends be here?

HALFREK

  Sweetie... they are.

18     EXT.     SUNNYDALE 

  HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

  At the construction site, Buffy talks to Xander.

XANDER

  So, how's it looking? Does the place pass inspection?

BUFFY

  Oh, it's great... if you're a zombie ghost thing!

XANDER

  So school's back in session, huh?

BUFFY

  Seems like old times.

A construction worker walks up to where they were talking, so Xander and 

  Buffy walk to somewhere more private to have their conversation.

XANDER

  So, zombies or ghosts?

BUFFY

  I'm not sure. They were in the mirror, but they disappeared. Um, but they touched 

  me, I think. Well, let's just start with dead and pissed.

XANDER

  They were after you personally?

BUFFY

  They talked about protecting people. Told me to leave.

XANDER

  No damage, though.

BUFFY

  I think I may have destroyed Dawn's social life in all of about 30 seconds, 

  but apart from that, no.

XANDER

  Ah, being popular isn't so great. Or so I've read in books.

BUFFY

  This isn't a coincidence, you know, the school being rebuilt. It means something.

XANDER

  As in what?

Cut to:

19     INT.     CLASSROOM 

  AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY

  Dawn is sitting at her desk. The nerd sitting beside her asks her a question.

NERD

  Could I borrow a pencil?

Dawn nods. She unzips the pencil pouch in her notebook, and takes out a 

  yellow pencil, and hands it to hand him. When she looks up, she sees that he 

  has transformed into a freaky dead guy.

DEAD NERD

  Thanks a lot.

Dead nerd takes the pencil and tries to stab Dawn's eye with it. She screams 

  and falls to the floor.

TEACHER

  Are you all right?

  Dawn looks around, and the Dead Nerd had disappeared. Her classmates are 

    all staring at her.

DAWN

  I'm sorry. There was... a... a bee. It flew in my eye. I'm very allergic.

Dawn stands up.

TEACHER

  I think it's gone.

DAWN

  Can I go to the bathroom?

TEACHER

  Of course.

Dawn leaves the room. The other students look at each other trying to figure 

  out what Dawn's problem was.

 STUDENT

  Guess it runs in the family.

Cut to:

20     INT.     RESTROOM 

  AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY

    Dawn goes into the restroom to gather her thoughts and recover from her scare. 

    She hides in the first stall and tries to catch her breath. She hears scared 

    crying from another stall. She gets up, leaves the stall, and checks for under 

    the other stall doors, looking for feet. No feet.

Cut to:

21     INT.     HALLWAY 

  AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY

  Buffy is walking in the hall in a hurry and isn't looking where she's going. 

  She bumps into the principal.

PRINCIPAL

  Whoa.

BUFFY

  Ooh, sorry.

PRINCIPAL

  Miss Summers. I didn't know you were still about.

BUFFY

  Uh, yeah, I was just looking for—

PRINCIPAL

  I thought in general it was customary for a person who's graduated to, um, 

  you know, go somewhere else. (laughs)

BUFFY

  Well, it's a new campus. I'm just getting to know it. You know, make sure it's 

  safe for my sister.

Cut to:

21     INT.     RESTROOM 

  AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY

  Dawn decides to check in the stalls one by one. Cautiously, she pushes in the 

  first door. Empty. Second stall is empty too. When she pushes in the door to 

  the third stall, there's a girl there, sitting fetal style with her feet on 

  top of the toilet seat.

DAWN

  Hey. What's wrong?

KIT

  There's someone in here.

Dawn looks around.

DAWN

  It's only me.

Kit shakes her head.

KIT

  No, it's not.

Cut to:

23     INT.     HALLWAY 

  AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY

  Buffy is still talking to the principal.

PRINCIPAL

  You know, I, um, have to be honest. I actually know a little bit more about 

  you than I let on before.

BUFFY

  Isn't that interesting.

PRINCIPAL

  Oh, it really is.

Cut to:

24     INT.     RESTROOM 

  AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY

  Dawn and Kit are still talking.

DAWN

  Let's get you out of here, OK? Maybe we can get some air. I'm Dawn.

KIT

  Kit.

DAWN

  Saw something pretty creepy, huh?

KIT

  You wouldn't believe me.

DAWN

  I kinda sorta think I will. Was there a pencil involved in any—

They look in the mirror and notice there are three dead people there (Dead 

  Girl, Dead Nerd, and Dead Janitor). The lights start exploding, sparks are shooting 

  out from them, and the floor is breaking under their feet. They scream. Hands 

  are reaching for them, pulling them down into the floor.

25     EXT.     ENGLISH 

  COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

  In front of the same building where they were talking before, Willow has fallen 

  onto the ground and appears to be in pain. Giles is with her, and tries to hold 

  her.

WILLOW

  Oh, God.

GILES

  Just breathe.

WILLOW

  I can't. God!

GILES

  Just breathe.

WILLOW

  What happened?

GILES

  What do you remember?

Willow props herself up with her hands on the ground.

WILLOW

  We were talking and I felt... 

She recoils and brings her hands away from the ground suddenly frightened. 

   

WILLOW

  I felt the Earth. It's all connected. It is, but it's not all good and pure 

  and rootsy. There's deep, deep black. There's... I saw, I saw the Earth, Giles. 

  I saw its teeth.

GILES

  The hell mouth.

WILLOW

  It's gonna open. It's gonna swallow us all.

  SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY

  The girls have fallen through the bathroom floor into the basement. There is 

  rubble all around them. They are on the floor, but appear to be undamaged. Kit 

  comes to first and goes to Dawn.

KIT

  Hey. Hey, wake up. Please wake up.

DAWN

  Oh, oh, God, uh... Are you OK?

KIT

  We have to leave.

DAWN

  You're not wrong. C'mon. There's got to be a staircase.

27     INT.     HALLWAY 

  AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY

  Buffy is still talking to the principal.

PRINCIPAL

  The school board recommended I spend a little time reading your record. 

  It's, um, quite a page-turner. Kind of a checkered past...

BUFFY

  Huh. More like a plaid. Kind of a clan tartan of badness, really. You know, 

  but there were factors.

Cut to:

28     INT.     BASEMENT 

  SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY

  The girls are walking around the basement, looking for an exit.

DAWN

  What did you see when I found you in the stall?

KIT

  A girl. She said she died here, and that everybody dies here, and that we would 

  too.

DAWN

  Here I was worried about not fitting in.

The girls run into someone unexpectedly in the basement and scream. It's 

  the boy who was playing with the basketball in the hallway earlier.

CARLOS

  Who are you?

KIT

  Who are you?

DAWN

  Are you dead?

CARLOS

  Stop saying that!

DAWN

  Whoa. We're not dead. We saw creepy dead people, and we're just trying to get 

  out.

CARLOS

  I just came down here for a smoke, you know, and I saw... it was a janitor. 

  He was yelling at me. I thought he was just pissed, but... I saw him in the 

  light.

DAWN

  Wait, you came downstairs? Where?

CARLOS

  Man, I got no clue. I ran away like a girl. I don't know this place at all.

DAWN

  OK, so we can run around in circles, or...

Dawn walks down the corridor, and the others follow. Then a voice comes 

  from behind.

DEAD JANITOR

  Do you really think you can run away?

KIT

  It's not real.

DAWN

  Lesson one: it's always real.

Dead people surround them now.

DEAD NERD

  I tried to run too.

DEAD GIRL

  I tried to scream. Doesn't matter how much you scream, nobody ever hears you.

DAWN

  Hear me. Right. Ooh. I got a present.

KIT

  What is it?

DAWN

  A weapon.

Dawn dials the new cell phone, the gift that Buffy gave her earlier today.

Cut to:

27     INT.     HALLWAY 

  AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY

  Buffy is still talking to the principal.

PRINCIPAL

  Well, it's clear your sister looks up to you, which I think is great.

BUFFY

  No, she's much, much worse than me. Troublemaker. Expulsion is really the only 

  way to go. You know, or you can suspend her for... three years.

PRINCIPAL

  Well, how 'bout we give her a chance first. Just as long as she keeps her grades 

  up, and—

Buffy's cell phone rings.

BUFFY

  Boy, that's loud.

PRINCIPAL

  That's a part of the reason we don't allow cell phones in—

BUFFY

  Excuse me. Yeah. (to Principal) Oh, sorry. My dog. Uh, dog walker. (Quietly, 

  into phone) Three dead? 

PRINCIPAL

  Oh, my God!

BUFFY

  Uh, no, I'll be right there.

PRINCIPAL

  Your dogs are dead?

DAWN

  And, Buffy? Isn't this reception amazing? I'm in the freakin' basement!

BUFFY

  OK. Sorry about that. I—I have to ... 

PRINCIPAL

  Yeah. No, of course. And good luck with that...dog tragedy.

  SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY

  Dawn hangs up the phone and talks to her two friends.

DAWN

  Help is on the way, you guys. We've just got to figure out—

She stops to look around and notices that her ghosts are nowhere to be found.

DAWN

  Where did they go?

Then a dead person's hand grabs her by the throat.

  SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY

  Buffy goes into the restroom where the girls fell into the basement. She sees 

  the hole in the floor and jumps down it.

  SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY

  Buffy wanders around the basement looking for Dawn.

BUFFY

  Dawn!

No answer, so Buffy tries calling her cell phone again. Dawn's phone rings 

  where Buffy can hear it.

BUFFY

  Dawn? I'm close by.

DEAD JANITOR

  Too late. But then, you're always too late, aren't you? Sure as hell didn't 

  save me.

She hangs up the phone.

BUFFY

  Where's my sister?

DEAD JANITOR

  I think she's lost.

BUFFY

  If I'm the one who let you die, why take it out on her? I'm right here. C'mon, 

  what're you after? Fear? Revenge? Tasty brains?

DEAD NERD

  I think I'd like Dawn to be my girlfriend.

BUFFY

  Again, wrong sister. I'm the one that dates dead guys. And, no offense, but 

  they were hotties. I mean, I'm sure you had a great personality, but...

DEAD GIRL

  Busy making out with your dead boyfriend while I was ripped to death by a werewolf? 

  (scoffs) Is that why you let me die?

DEAD NERD

  I was screaming for help when they pulled me down—

Buffy makes a "T" with her hands, gesturing for a timeout.

BUFFY

  Hello! Not making myself clear. I don't care how you died. I'm sorry for your 

  loss, but where is my sister? Dawn!

DEAD JANITOR

  She's not gonna hear you. This place is like a maze. 

DEAD GIRL

  This place is ours now. It was built on our graves.

DEAD JANITOR

  All we want is for you to leave so we can rest again.

BUFFY

  Actually, I'm thinking all you want is to get between me and that door. Who's 

  for finding out why.

Dead Nerd lunges at Buffy, who pushes him out of the way. Then Dead Girl 

  jumps on her back, and Buffy falls back to the ground to knock her off. When 

  Buffy gets up, she thought she had taken them all out, but suddenly all three 

  dead people are standing in front of the door again, like they reappeared there 

  supernaturally.

BUFFY

  If at first you don't succeed...

Buffy leaps over them.

BUFFY

  ... cheat!

They jump her again. She fights them off and goes for the door.

BUFFY

  Dawnie, we have to get o—

When she opens the door, much to her surprise, it's not Dawn behind the 

  door after all. She's staring into the face of a longer-haired Spike. He looks 

  grim, and not the least bit happy to see her. Buffy is astonished.

  Fade to black.

ACT IV

31     INT.     BASEMENT 

  SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY

  Resume.

BUFFY

  Spike? Are you real?

Spike laughs and looks funny at her. He stops laughing, and touches his 

  hand tenderly to her face.

SPIKE

  Buffy, duck.

BUFFY

  What? Duck? There's a duck?

  From behind, the Dead Janitor hits her over the head with a pipe.

SPIKE

  No visitors today. Terribly busy.

  The Dead Janitor starts beating on Buffy with the pipe.

DEAD NERD

  Told you to get out.

Buffy trips the Dead Janitor, making him fall to the floor. She jumps up 

  and uses the door where she found Spike to hit the Dead Janitor's head. Then 

  she goes into the room and latches the door behind her.

BUFFY

  He'll probably show up in a sec. 

SPIKE

  Nobody comes in here. It's just the three of us.

BUFFY

  Spike, have you seen Dawn? She came down here with some kids.

SPIKE

  (Yelling) Don't you think I'm trying? I'm not fast. I'm not a quick study. 

  (Suddenly crying) I droped my board in the water and the chalk all ran. Sure 

  to be caned. (Laughs) Should've seen that coming.

He moves away from Buffy into a corner, but she follows. His unbuttoned 

  shirt was loose, but he covered his chest with it, crossed his arms, and leaned 

  his back against the wall. She reaches for his shirt to see what he was hiding. 

  He looks away. There are numerous deep gashes on the upper left side of his 

  chest, like he has been clawed.

BUFFY

  What did you do?

SPIKE

  I tried... I... tried to cut it out.

Buffy doesn't understand what's going on with Spike. He's clearly acting 

  strange, but her cell phone rings before she can figure it out. She turns away 

  from him to answer it.

BUFFY

  Dawn?

DAWN

  Buffy, where are you?

BUFFY

  I... 

Buffy is distracted by Spike's barely audible mumbling. He has crouched 

  down on the floor on his tiptoes.

BUFFY

  Look, where are you? 

DAWN

  I don't know. In a room by the furnace. Near where we fell in. They dragged 

  us in here, and then they disappeared.

BUFFY

  Yeah, they came after me too.

DAWN

  Well, what do they want?

BUFFY

  So far, to piss me off.

DAWN

  Please, tell me it's working.

BUFFY

  Oh, I'm damage-bound. I just can't figure them. Ghosts can't touch you and 

  zombies can't disappear, so I don't know what—

SPIKE

  Not ghosts.

DAWN

  Who was that?

BUFFY

  (To the phone) Hold on. (To Spike) You know what they are?

SPIKE

  Manifest spirits controlled by a talisman, raised to seek vengeance. A 4-year-old 

  could figure it.

BUFFY

  (To the phone) Hang tight. I'll find you. These things can hurt you. You can 

  hurt them too. Find a weapon. I'll come for you. (To Spike) Spike, you gonna 

  help me out?

SPIKE

  This is my home. I belong here. Always been here. Cheers for stopping by. 

Spike walks away from Buffy. He faces the wall and puts his hands on it.

SPIKE

  (To himself) It's in the wall.

Spike turns away from her to put his hands on the wall. He starts to moan 

  softly.

BUFFY

  I'll get back to you.

She kicks down the door and leaves the room.

BUFFY

  Guys? Resentful dead guys? This can't be good. Come on, manifest spirits, raised 

  up, controlled by a... talisman.

Buffy makes a call on her cell phone.

BUFFY

  Xander...

  Dawn, Kit, and Carlos are in a different area of the basement than Buffy.

DAWN

  We need to find some kind of weapon just to hold them off.

Carlos finds some bricks on a nearby utility shelf.

CARLOS

  I got these.

DAWN

  Kit, gimme your bag.

Dawn empties the contents of Kit's purse on the floor and replaces them 

  with the bricks. Buffy is still looking for them in the basement.

KIT

  Do you think they're gonna come back?

DEAD GIRL

  Think they're gonna come back? We never left. We'll always be here. Just like 

  you.

KIT

  No. 

DEAD GIRL

  Why do you think we picked you? The ones no one will miss. The ones that don't 

  belong. You spend all your time trying to get out of high school, and now you'll 

  never ever leave.

Dawn swings the brick-bag at the Dead Girl's knees and knocks her down. 

  The Dead Janitor knocks Dawn back with a punch to the face. Dawn shrieks. Buffy 

  hears her and runs toward the scream.

  Xander enters the restroom and sees the floor has fallen in.

XANDER

  Whoa. Contracty goodness. Talisman, talisman.

He edges himself around the hole in the floor to move toward the mirrors 

  and sinks.

  The dead people are still fighting Dawn and friends. The dead janitor attacks 

  Dawn, who screams.

DEAD JANITOR

  You can thank your sister for this.

  Buffy enters the room, and the Dead Nerd comes at her with a pipe. She 

    pushes him away and kicks the Dead Janitor away from Dawn.

DAWN

  Thanks, sis.

BUFFY

  We just need to keep them at bay.

The dead people keep attacking Buffy and Dawn. 

DAWN

  The bag!

Buffy kicks butt with the brick-bag and her karate kicks.

  After the dead people vanish in front of their eyes, the kids have a look of 

  awe on their faces.

CARLOS

  Are they gone?

BUFFY

  Yeah. The talisman must have been destroyed.

DAWN

  How'd you know it was a talisman?

BUFFY

  There's always a talisman. The real question is who put it there. C'mon, you 

  guys, let's go find a way upstairs, assuming there is one.

DAWN

  You really weren't kidding about this place. I guess it hasn't changed.

BUFFY

  I don't know. Seems smaller.

Cut to:

39     INT.     HALLWAY 

  AT SUNNYDALE HIGH- DAY

  Buffy is standing in the hallway, talking to Dawn, Kit, and Carlos. 

BUFFY

  You guys are gonna be OK. School is intense, but you'll do all right as 

  long as you're careful. And you might want to think about sticking together.

KIT

  Thank you.

Kit hugs Buffy.

CARLOS

  Yeah, I mean it. You are the coolest mom ever.

Buffy looks self-conscious and plays with her hair. Dawn saves her from 

  further embarrassment by ushering her friends away.

DAWN

  OK. Come on, we still have a few more classes to live through.

Dawn kisses Buffy on the cheek, and walks away with her friends. The principal 

  walks up to Buffy.

PRINCIPAL

  Curiouser and curiouser.

BUFFY

  What is?

PRINCIPAL

  Carlos Trejo and Kit Holburn, right? Possibly the only two students in this 

  school whose files are as thick as yours was.

BUFFY

  You really did your homework, didn't you?

PRINCIPAL

  I was looking for one or both of them to actually implode in a fearsome way 

  right before midterms. And now I see that you got 'em socializing and hugging 

  and actually, if I'm not mistaken, headed to class.

BUFFY

  Well, we shared an... encounter.

PRINCIPAL

  Look, I know you're probably more than happy to get out of this place. But 

  I gotta tell you, Miss Summers, I think you belong here.

BUFFY

  Hmm, new?

PRINCIPAL

  Listen, I know this school's reputation. What, you think I got this job based 

  on seniority? We got a lot of troubled students here, and just enough money 

  to keep this place from caving in.

BUFFY

  Yeah, you might need a little extra there.

PRINCIPAL

  Well, we do have a community outreach program. And the money we could pay you... 

  wouldn't even fold. But it would just be a couple of days a week.

BUFFY

  Are you asking me to be a counselor?

PRINCIPAL

  Well, we have a guidance counselor, but I was thinking the kids could use someone, 

  you know, closer to their age who still—

BUFFY

  I'm in!

PRINCIPAL

  What, you serious? You—you did hear the part about the money, right?

BUFFY

  Yeah, I heard. My schedule might be a little funtastic, but, uh, I'll work 

  it out. I'd like to keep an eye on this place.

PRINCIPAL

  Well, that's great. Look at that. It's not even noon, and I've already bullied 

  my first family member into helping out. I'm going to be the best principal 

  ever.

Principal walks away. Buffy looks pleased like maybe things will work out 

  after all.

Cut to:

  SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY

  Back in the room where Spike was. He's still crouched down on the floor on his 

  tiptoes, hugging his knees. He looks vulnerable, like he's in there with someone 

  or something dangerous.

SPIKE

  The thing is...I had a speech. I learned it all. Oh, God. She won't understand, 

  she won't understand.

  Warren is circling Spike, addressing him as Spike cowers in the middle 

    of the room.

 WARREN

  Of course she won't understand, Sparky. I'm beyond her understanding. She's 

  a girl. Sugar and spice and everything...useless unless you're baking. I'm more 

  than that. More than flesh...

  Warren morphs into Glory, who is still pacing and talking to Spike.

 GLORY

  ...more than blood. I'm... you know, I honestly don't think there's a human 

  word fabulous enough for me. Oh, my name will be on everyone's lips, assuming 

  their lips haven't been torn off. But not just yet. That's alright, though...

  Glory morphs into Adam. Apparently this monster is something that can 

    change shape and impersonate other characters. The Morphing Monster is still 

    pacing.

MORPHING MONSTER (as ADAM)

  ...I can be patient. Everything is well within parameters. She's exactly where 

  I want her to be. And so are you, Number 17. You're right where you belong.

  Morphing Monster changes to the Mayor and bends down on one knee to talk 

    to Spike at eye-level.

  MORPHING MONSTER (as THE MAYOR)

    So what'd you think? You'd get your soul back and everything'd be Jim Dandy? 

    Soul's slipperier than a greased weasel. Why do you think I sold mine? (laughs) 

    Well, you probably thought that you'd be your own man, and I respect that, 

    but...

MORPHING MONSTER (as DRUSILLA)

    (touching Spike's face) ...you never will. You'll always be mine. You'll always 

    be in the dark with me, singing our little songs. You like our little songs, 

    don't you? You've always liked them, right from the beginning. And that's 

    where we're going...

  MORPHING MONSTER (as THE MASTER)

    (stands) ...right back to the beginning. Not the Bang... not the Word... the 

    true beginning. The next few months are going to be quite a ride. And I think 

    we're all going to learn something about ourselves in the process. You'll 

    learn you're a pathetic schmuck, if it hasn't sunk in already. Look at you. 

    Trying to do what's right, just like her. You still don't get it. It's not 

    about right, not about wrong...

  Morphing Monster walks around behind Spike, and when it reappears, it 

    has transformed into Buffy. As Buffy, it is standing with arms crossed in 

    front, with a smug and serious look on her face, glaring at Spike.

MORPHING MONSTER (as BUFFY)

  ...it's about power.
