  RECAP: (Skip Recap...)
  GILES (V.O.)
    Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
  1     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT
    Jonathan is packing up his bag, when Andrew comes to him and puts his right 
    hand on Jonathan's shoulder. Jonathan looks up at Andrew, stands. Jonathan's 
    eyes widen as Andrew takes his left hand and stabs him in the belly with a 
    dagger. Jonathan looks at Andrew, hurt. Jonathan collapses onto the metal 
    object that they unearthed. He bleeds profusely, with his blood filling the 
    grooves in the object.
  XANDER (V.O.)
  You killed your best friend.
  Cut to:
  2     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Andrew leads Buffy, Dawn, and Xander to the room where he killed Jonathan.
ANDREW
  It didn't work 'cause there wasn't enough blood.
  Cut to:
  3     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT
    Spike is tied to the wheel-like construct with all four corners of his body 
    pulled in opposite directions. Spike's body has symbols carved into his chest. 
    Spike/First morphs into Buffy's form. A Harbinger cranks a wheel attached 
    to a mechanism that hoists the wheel Spike's tied to into the air. Spike is 
    now hanging from the wheel about ten feet from the ground, bleeding steadily 
    from his ritualized symbol-shaped cuts.
BUFFY
  I bet that's what the First needed Spike for.
  Spike's blood is falling on the Seal of Danthazar that's right below him. 
    It's pooling in the grooves and being absorbed into the seal. The seal starts 
    to glow. One by one, the pointed tips of the pentagram at its center fold 
    up, forming a pyramid. Light comes out from under it. 
  Cut to:
  4     INT.     DINING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Xander is squatting next to Andrew's chair, untying him. 
BUFFY
  We don't have time to baby-sit a hostage.
ANDREW
  I'll be good. 
  Cut to:
  5     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    After covering up the seal, Buffy and Dawn walk out of the Seal of Danthazar 
    room. Principal Wood passes them in the basement hallway, carrying a shovel, 
    looking a little disheveled.
  PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Apparently somebody left this in the courtyard, and I was just returning it.
BUFFY
  That's some full-service principaling.
  PRINCIPAL WOOD
  I try.
  Cut to:
  6     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Spike is sitting on a cot, his wrists chained to the wall. Suddenly, his face 
    contorts and he twitches.
  SPIKE
  Ow ow ow! (leans back, thrashes against the wall, holds his hands to his head, 
  writhing in intense pain)
BUFFY
  There's gotta be a reason why the chip is going all wonky.
  Cut to:
  7     INT.     THE INITIATIVE 
    SUNNYDALE HEADQUARTERS - DAY
    Buffy's standing outside the examination room where Spike is lying on a table. 
    The lead soldier comes up to her. She turns to look at him.
  SOLDIER
  This chip...we can either repair it... or remove it.
  Buffy blinks, looks down, and takes a deep breath.
  Cut to:
  8     INT.     FLAT 
    IN ENGLAND - DAY
    Giles enters the flat and sees Robson, who's found near a chair in the next 
    room. Giles goes to his side.
  GILES
  Robson!
  XANDER (V.O.)
  Robson blacked out, but the last thing he remembers is Giles's head about to 
  get real familiar with a Bringer's very sharp axe.
  ROBSON
  (eyes flash open) It's started... 
  A Bringer steps up behind Giles, carrying an axe.
  Fade to black.

    The Start Of Episode
  
  PROLOGUE:
  9     INT.     FLAT IN 
    ENGLAND - DAY
    Resume. Giles is talking to Robson while a Bringer sneaks up behind him, wielding 
    an axe.
GILES
  I understand. I'll take care of i—
  One of the robed men sneaks up behind Giles wielding a battle-axe. He swings 
    it at Giles. Giles grabs the shaft of the axe right before the blade touches 
    him. He stands, punches the Bringer in the stomach, and takes control of the 
    axe. Holding the axe handle with a hand on either end, he knocks the Bringer 
    in the chin, sending him backwards into a chair. Giles swings the axe at the 
    Bringer's neck, chopping off its head.
  Cut to:
  10     EXT.     CEMETARY 
    IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT
    Giles is telling his story to the girls as they patrol. Buffy, Kennedy, Amanda 
    and a new slayer in training are with him.
GILES
  It was, uh, extraordinary good luck, of course. And—and, uh, training—years 
  of training. Chao-Ahn, keep up. You're new here, Chao-Ahn, so take note. Remember 
  about training. But I honestly feel the largest part of it was instinct. Instinct 
  and-and reflexes. There's a sort of wary watchfulness I've developed over the 
  years. It's like another sense—
  From out of nowhere, someone attacks Giles, knocking him to the ground. 
    It's Spike.
  BUFFY
    (worried) Spike!

     
      (simultaneously)
    
     
       
      GILES
       
      SPIKE
    
     
       
      Hey!
       
      Hey!
    
     
       
      You're not in pain.
       
      You're not the First.
    
  
  GILES
  What?
SPIKE
  Anya said you were the First. Said you were evil. You're supposed to be all 
  go-through-able. (stands, walks to Buffy's side)
GILES
    (stands) Then what the hell did you tackle me for, you berk? What's that supposed 
    to do?
SPIKE
  I, uh, I didn't think of that.
GILES
  More importantly, you just hit me. Why didn't your chip go off?
SPIKE
  (looks down) Yeah, well...
BUFFY
  Well, uh, when we were at the Initiative... (looks at Spike)
SPIKE
  (looks at Buffy) There was a choice.
BUFFY
  (looks at Giles) Right. Either repair the chip, or to remove it.
GILES
  You had it remov—You removed the chip?
BUFFY
  (smiling, trying to look innocent) Yeah.
SPIKE
  Had to make a choice.
BUFFY
  It really is OK.
AMANDA
  What's a chip?
KENNEDY
  They removed the chip?
  CHAO-AHN
  (speaking Chinese)
  SUBTITLE: I don't understand a word any of you are saying.

  Opening Credits.
  ACT I:
  11     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Buffy's sitting at her vanity, putting on large gold hoop earrings. She's 
    wearing a thin v-necked red sweater. Giles walks down the hall toward her 
    room and stops at the doorway.
GILES
  You know this is very dangerous.
BUFFY
  Ah, you just heard the horror stories. Wear hoops, they'll catch on something, 
  rip your lobe off. Lobes flying everywhere.
GILES
  (rolls eyes) That's not what I'm talking about.
BUFFY
  You mean Spike not having a chip. Free range Spike?
GILES
  I have to ask—why on Earth did you make that decision?
BUFFY
  Guess it was instinct, like you were talking about.
GILES
  I made that up! (walks into the room) I knew the Bringer was there because his 
  shoes squeaked. (sits on her vanity) Buffy, it's crucial that we keep these 
  girls safe. I can't count the dangers—the First, the Bringers, random demons, 
  and now Spike?
BUFFY
  And the Principal.
GILES
  What?
BUFFY
  Oh, nothing much. He was in the school basement, holding a shovel, acting evasive. 
  Plus, he's got that whole "too charming to be real" thing going on. 
  I'm looking into it.
GILES
  (stands) Oh, well that sounds very responsible of you. Balances out the vampire-on-the-loose 
  issue.
BUFFY
  (stands, walks across the room to fold laundry) Nothing's changed, Giles. Spike 
  had a chip before, remember? When the First had him kill and sire all those 
  people.
GILES
  We have no idea if his chip was working then. (takes off glasses) A new chip 
  might restrain him should the First attempt to activate him again.
BUFFY
  (turns to face Giles) Spike has a soul now. That's what's gonna stop him from 
  hurting people.
GILES
  Buffy...
BUFFY
  He can be a good man, Giles. I feel it. But he's never gonna get there if we 
  don't give him the chance. (walks to her closet to put the clothes away)
GILES
  (walks up to Buffy) Buffy, I want more for you. Your feelings for him are coloring 
  your judgement. I can hear it in your voice. (Buffy sighs) And that way lies 
  a future filled with pain. I don't want that for you.
BUFFY
    We haven't— (looks uncomfortable) Things have been different since he 
    came back.
GILES
  It doesn't matter if you're not physical with each other anymore. There's a 
  connection. You rely on him, he relies on you. That's what's affecting your 
  judgment.
BUFFY
  You think I'm losing sight of the big picture, but I'm not. When Spike had that 
  chip, it was like having him in a muzzle. It was wrong. You can't beat evil 
  by doing evil. I know that. (walks out of the room) 
GILES
  (calling after her, calmly) Well, I hope you're right. You're gambling with 
  a lot of lives.

  12     EXT.     HOME 
    IMPROVEMENT STORE - DAY
    Xander's standing around in a crowd of customers watching a green-aproned 
    store employee cut a length of pipe with a huge power tool. He looks around 
    and notices a pretty woman looking at the spools of rope on a display. Xander 
    walks over to her, taking off his safety glasses.
XANDER
  Hi, can I help? You seem kind of confused. 
  WOMAN
  (holding a rope, looks at his clothes) You aren't wearing a green apron.
XANDER
  Confused, but sort of randomly observant.
  WOMAN
  Sorry, I just mean... you don't work here, right?
XANDER
  No. Right. Just helpful. I'm Xander.
  WOMAN
  Lissa. (they shake hands) And I guess I could use some advice. I can't even 
  figure out if I've got the right kind of rope. 
XANDER
  That depends on what you need it for. Something like functional around the house, 
  or, you know, recreational. (Lissa raises her eyebrows and grins) By which I 
  mean, for example, boating or mountain climbing—not for tying someone up for 
  sexy, funky fun. (Lissa giggles) In conclusion, rope can be useful in various 
  ways.
  WOMAN/LISSA
  I have a kayak.
XANDER
  Again with the random. I like it.
LISSA
  Sorry. I need to store my kayak. So I was thinking maybe I could sorta suspend 
  it from the ceiling in the garage with ropes and a pulley or a winch thing.
XANDER
  Not a bad plan. You'll need stronger rope than that. Wanna have coffee with 
  me later?
LISSA
  What?
XANDER
  Oh, you're the only one that gets to be random? (Lissa smiles) 
  Cut to:
  13     INT.     PRINCIPAL 
    WOOD'S OFFICE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    While no one is looking, Buffy walks into the office labeled "Principal. 
    Robin M. Wood" on it and closes the door behind her. She looks through 
    files on his desk, then looks around the room.
BUFFY
  Now, if I were a sign of being evil, where would I be? 
  Buffy notices a wall cabinet, and walks up to it. Before she can open it, 
    Principal Wood walks into the office. 
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Uh, Buffy?
BUFFY
  (turns to face him) Principal Wood. It's you.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  You looking for something?
BUFFY
  File folders. And mechanical pencils. Well, I want to write on a file folder 
  with a mechanical pencil.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  The supply cabinet in the outer office has those things.
BUFFY
  Oh, this isn't a supply cabinet? My bad. OK. Thanks. (starts to walk out)
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  (steps in her path) Hey, Buffy...
BUFFY
  Yeah?
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Um, what're you doing tonight?
BUFFY
  Preparing for tomorrow's counseling sessions.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  No, really.
BUFFY
  Watching a reality show about a millionaire.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
    Well, then, I'd, um— I'd like to take you out to dinner, if that's all 
    right with you. I mean, you don't have to. I'm certainly not saying come to 
    dinner if you enjoy having a job. (chuckles then realizes what he said) You 
    know, I may have to make up a document saying I didn't just say that and have 
    you sign it.
BUFFY
  (smiles) Sure. I'd be happy to have dinner with you.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Great. I'll draw up the paperwork.
  Buffy nods and walks out of the office. Principal Wood closes his office 
    door after her, then takes a bloody handkerchief out of his breast pocket. 
    He unfolds the bloody handkerchief, revealing a knife inside. Wiping the blood 
    off the knife, he walks toward the cabinet Buffy had been curious about. Upon 
    opening it, there's just a standard dry-erase board inside until the Principal 
    raises it out of the way to show a hidden compartment behind it where dozens 
    of exotic knives are displayed. He puts the knife he's holding back in it's 
    place and looks over his shoulder toward the door.
  Fade to black.
  ACT II:
  14     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Buffy's sitting on the couch while Willow's folding laundry from the laundry 
    basket beside her.
WILLOW
  (folding socks) So, he asked you out to dinner?
BUFFY
  Yeah. Isn't that weird? I mean, he's a Principal. He's a young, hot Principal 
  with earrings, but he's a Principal. Why do you think he asked me out? I mean, 
  he could be interested, right?
WILLOW
  Yeah, sure. You're a frisky vixen.
BUFFY
  Or, it could be work-related. Maybe I'm getting promoted for doing such a good 
  job.
WILLOW
  (laughs, then notices Buffy's hurt look and gets serious) Oh, right, that—that 
  makes sense too.
BUFFY
  Or, maybe he knows that I suspect he's up to something, and he's taking me out 
  to kill me.
WILLOW
  (shrugs) Well, you'll have to dress for the ambiguity.
BUFFY
  You know, it's not even that he's acting that suspicious. It's just—there he 
  is. On the hell mouth. All day, every day. That's got to be like being showered 
  with evil. Only from underneath.
WILLOW
  Not really a shower.
BUFFY
  A bidet. Like a bidet of evil.
WILLOW
  Buff, if he's really interested, (smiles) are you interested back?
BUFFY
  (blushes) I don't know. He's good-looking, and he's—he's solid, he's smart, 
  he's normal. So, not the wicked energy, which is nice 'cause I don't want to 
  only be attracted to wicked energy. Or what if he is wicked, in which case, 
  is that why I'm attracted to him?
WILLOW
  I'm gonna wait for that sentence to come around again before I jump on. 
BUFFY
  (grins) You know what? Yeah, I mean I think I like him. And he'd be good for 
  me.
WILLOW
  (nods) Right. Help you move on.
BUFFY
    (defensively) Why does everybody in this house think I'm still in love with 
    Spike?
WILLOW
  No, I-I meant move on from this imposed super-self-reliance. Let somebody get 
  close.
BUFFY
  Oh. (the front door opens) Hey, someone's here.
XANDER
  (comes in through the front door, giddy) Guys, guess what happened.
WILLOW
  (grins) Buffy got a date!
XANDER
  (excited) No, I did. (looks at Buffy, frowning) Fine. Way to steal my thunder.
BUFFY
  Sorry. If it makes you feel better, it's Principal Wood, and I think he's aligned 
  with the First.
XANDER
  Also, like ten years older than you, right?
WILLOW
    (teasing) Which is like 100 years younger than your type!
BUFFY
  Yay. Someone who doesn't remember the Industrial Revolution.
WILLOW
  I think they're gonna end up making out. (mocking, holds a pair of socks to 
  her chest lovingly) "Oh, Principal Wood," she'll gasp, "I love 
  your lack of wicked energy."
BUFFY
  (throws a pair of socks at Willow) Watch it, or I'm gonna make you talk about 
  your new girlfriend who you hold hands with under the dinner table and think 
  we don't notice. 
WILLOW
  How 'bout yours, Xander. Is she evil?
XANDER
    Well, she's interested in me, so there's a good chance, but I'm hoping for 
    the best. We're going for coffee. She has a kayak—
  Giles and Chao-Ahn come through the front door, loaded with overflowing 
    shopping bags.
GILES
    (putting down the shopping bags) Dear lord, I hate that mall. The shop assistants 
    are rude. And everything in the Food Court is sticky. 
WILLOW
  Looks like you found her some stuff. 
GILES
  Oh, hello. Yes. 
XANDER
  That's gotta be rough. Getting just like pulled out of your home, being told 
  you're a potential slayer, not being able to bring anything.
GILES
  Yes, and the language barrier is formidable. I was concerned that my Mandarin 
  is a little thin, but as it turns out, she speaks Cantonese, which is thinner. 
  But we muddled through, and, as I suspected, ice cream is a universal language.
  CHAO-AHN
  (speaking Chinese)
  SUBTITLE: Like many from Asia, I am lactose intolerant. I'm very uncomfortable.
BUFFY
  (smiling, nodding, talking through her closed teeth) What'd she say?
GILES
  She's grateful to be in the land of plenty. (to Chao-Ahn, slowly) Let's, um, 
  go and put away your new clothes. (picks up bags and walks upstairs; Chao-Ahn 
  nods and follows)
BUFFY
  Hey, Will, do you think you can do a computer check on Principal Wood. See if 
  you can find anything out.
WILLOW
  Yeah, sure. Want me to check your girl out while I'm at it, Xand?
XANDER
  Nope. I'm going in blind. I'm gonna be an optimist about this. Why go looking 
  for trouble? If it's gonna find you, it's gonna find you.
  Cut to:
  15     INT.     KITCHEN 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Andrew's standing by the new microwave that's on the counter, reading the 
    manual, holding a highlighter pen.
ANDREW
  (reading the cover page) "Getting the most out of your new microwave." 
  (nods) Hm. Nice. (opens the manual, reading) "Clock comma setting the, 
  page 3." (leans the manual on the countertop to highlight text in it)
JONATHAN/FIRST
  You don't need a manual, it's intuitive. (Andrew notices Jonathan/First and 
  backs away into the corner) There's a button marked "Clock Set" for 
  pity's sake. What kind of a nerd are you? (scoffs) No wonder you crashed your 
  jet pack.
ANDREW
  No, get thee behind me. (takes a cross out of his jeans pocket) I rebuke thee. 
  (holds out the cross) Take that, The First!
JONATHAN/FIRST
  (rolls his eyes) Look, you monkey. (walks up to Andrew, sticks out his hand 
  and passes through the cross) Ooh. Ahh. It burns as it ineffectually passes 
  through me. (puts his hand at his side) I'm not corporeal, remember. Also, not 
  a vampire, so—a cross?
ANDREW
  (puts the cross on the counter) What do you want from me, Jonathan slash The 
  First?
JONATHAN/FIRST
  I have an assignment for you.
ANDREW
  Um, I follow Buffy's orders now. I'm redeeming myself for... killing you—I 
  mean, for... killing Jonathan.
JONATHAN/FIRST
  Really, why? (laughs) So you can earn a spot on her little pep squad? You think 
  she'll ever let you in? You're a murderer.
ANDREW
  (nods) Confidentially, a lot of her people are murderers. Anya and Willow and 
  Spike.
JONATHAN/FIRST
  Interesting. And you're the only one she makes seek redemption. Does that seem 
  fair to you?
ANDREW
  (squirms in place) I guess not.
JONATHAN/FIRST
  You know we're headed toward a fight, don't you?
ANDREW
  Yeah.
JONATHAN/FIRST
  What do you think the world's gonna be like after that? Newsflash. There's not 
  going to be a slayer gang anymore. But there is going to be Evil. And as long 
  as there is Evil, I live. And as long as I live, you can dwell at my side.
ANDREW
  That sounds nice.
JONATHAN/FIRST
  Your assignment won't be hard. They're just little girls. 
ANDREW
  You want me to hurt the girls?
JONATHAN/FIRST
  Uh, no, not all of them. Not Dawn, not Anya, not Willow, and not your friend 
  Buffy. Just the potential slayers.
ANDREW
  That's—that's horrible. (points) I'm-I'm gonna scream and—and get Buffy in 
  here. 
JONATHAN/FIRST
  She can't see me, and I'm gonna keep talking until you hear what I have to say, 
  so listen up, OK? The girls must die.
ANDREW
  (breathes deeply) I could never do that. All those girls, a-all that blood—I-I 
  didn't like the stabbing before.
JONATHAN/FIRST
  You don't have to stab. This'll be easy. Andrew, I want you to think. Willow 
  brought something to this house—something good, something you can use.
ANDREW
  (thinks for a moment, then gestures spokes-model-style) The new microwave?
JONATHAN/FIRST
  (blinks deliberately, then glares) The gun. I want you to think hard. Where 
  did they put the gun?
ANDREW
  Hmm.

    BATHROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Anya's cleaning a spot on a blouse while Buffy waits wearing jeans and a lace 
    camisole.
ANYA
  I don't think it's really a date. That's what I think. (scrubbing the shirt)
BUFFY
  Well, it is unclear. That's why I chose a top that says, you know, I'm comfortable 
  in a stodgy office or a swinging casual setting—or killing you, you know, if 
  you're a demon.
ANYA
  It also says I sometimes get blood on my shoulder. (looks at the shirt again) 
  Or it might be pizza. (hands the shirt to Buffy) I don't think I can fix it.
BUFFY
  Thanks for trying.
ANYA
  And I wasn't talking about your date anyway. I was talking about this sham date 
  of Xander's. I think it's part of a plan to make me jealous.
BUFFY
  (shakes her head) Well, it's not working.
ANYA
  Are you nuts? Of course it's working. Observe my-my bitter ranting. Hear the 
  shrill edge of hysteria in my voice.
BUFFY
  Um, I should really go find something else to wear. (walks out of the room)
ANYA
  Fine, go. Leave me here to stew in my impotent rage. (Buffy stops, turns to 
  look at Anya) I'm also gonna pee, (nods) so you should probably go. (shrugs)
  Cut to:
  17     INT.     UPSTAIRS 
    HALLWAY AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Buffy steps out of the bathroom into the hallway to find Spike walking down 
    the hall. They are face to face. Buffy stops in her tracks as soon as she 
    sees him and tries to cover herself with the stained blouse.
SPIKE
  You look nice.
BUFFY
  Oh, thanks. (looks down at her camisole) Uh, traditionally, one wears something 
  over this.
SPIKE
  Heard you got a date.
BUFFY
  (nervous) Well, it's unclear. I mean, I have this whole theory about a promotion. 
  Or he's evil.
SPIKE
  Buffy, I'm all right.
BUFFY
  You don't have to—
SPIKE
  What? Be noble? I'm not. Really, I'm all right. Think I still dream of a crypt 
  for two with a white picket fence? My eyes are clear.
BUFFY
  Good. I'm glad. Thank you.
SPIKE
  Never much cared for picket fences, anyway. Bloody dangerous.
BUFFY
  You should try this too. The going out thing, I mean. I mean, there's that girl 
  you brought to Anya and Xander's not-a-wedding.
SPIKE
  Oh, yeah, right. There's always girls who like the look—bad boy, you know. 
  (nods) Does it for some of them.
BUFFY
  Yeah, I can see that. I should go. I don't wanna be late.
  Buffy walks down the hall past Spike.

    SHOP - NIGHT
    Xander's sitting alone at a table, staring at the clock on the wall; it reads 
    8:30. Xander sighs to himself for a moment, then Lissa walks in.
XANDER
  Lissa! Hi. (stands) I was afraid you weren't coming. 
LISSA
  You said 8:30, right? Did you think I was going to stand you up? (sits) 
XANDER
  (sits) Well, it would be kind of karmic. 
LISSA
  What?
XANDER
    Forget it. I'm just glad you're here. You're gonna love the coffee. Got myself 
    a redeye—it's black coffee with a shot of espresso. (Lissa grabs his 
    mug to inspect it, Xander tries unsuccessfully to stop her) It's kinda rough 
    if you're not used to that sort of thing—
LISSA
  (tastes Xander's drink) It's hot cocoa. 
XANDER
  Well, sometimes I don't sleep too good. I just lost macho points, didn't I?
LISSA
  (shrugs) Hey, who wants macho? I like that you like hot cocoa. (to waiter) Redeye, 
  please. (shrugs) Sounded good.

    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Willow's sitting at the dining room table, using her laptop, with Dawn and 
    Amanda on either side of her and Kennedy behind her looking on.
DAWN
  Nothing? No records or certificates? College transcripts?
AMANDA
  Looks like the only stuff in the system about Principal Robin Wood is super-recent. 
  Like, since he moved to Sunnydale.
WILLOW
  I've Googled 'til I just can't Google no more. He's not in there.
KENNEDY
  Well, that's suspicious.
  Anya storms into the dining room holding a stack of papers. Giles follows.
GILES
  Anya, calm down. They're educational—
WILLOW
  (Anya hands the papers to Willow) What's this?
  Willow flips through the papers. They are crude stick-figure drawings in 
    black and red marker depicting "Bringer" on one, "Vampire" 
    on another, and "The Slayer (Buffy)" as well. There are more, but 
    we get the idea. Each one shows a gruesome, bloody mess as the creature shown 
    is drawn killing someone or something.
ANYA
  Giles made them for Chao-Ahn, and now she's locked herself in the bathroom. 
  There's other girls upstairs, and they're starting to complain.
GILES
  Those are flashcards. I-I made them to facilitate her training. Chao-Ahn never 
  had a watcher. The language problem—
WILLOW
  You showed her these?
GILES
  I wanted her to understand the seriousness of her situation.
DAWN
  Holy crap!
  Dawn holds up one of the pages labeled "Turok-Han" that shows 
    the creature standing over a girl that's been ripped in half along her waistline, 
    spilling a huge pool of blood everywhere.
GILES
  Perhaps I'll rethink the approach.
WILLOW
  In the meanwhile, wanna help us get researchy? We're trying to invade Buffy's 
  date's privacy.
GILES
  Buffy has a date?
ANYA
  (rolls her eyes) Yes... Didn't you hear? Everybody has a date. Buffy has a date. 
  Willow's been completely making out with this girl—
KENNEDY
  (stands, pouts) Hey!
ANYA
  Xander's out with some hardware-store-whore. It's Date Fest 2003. (sits)
WILLOW
  Actually, Buffy's investigating Principal Wood. It's not a date.
GILES
  Really.
WILLOW
  Might be a date.
GILES
  For God's sake! How can anyone think about their social life? We are about to 
  fight the original primal evil. These girls are in mortal danger. Didn't you 
  see the flashcards? This isn't right.
  From behind the French doors, Andrew is stealthily watching them talk in 
    the dining room.

    IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT
    Buffy and Principal Wood are walking down a dark alley side by side. Buffy 
    looks around, uncomfortable.
BUFFY
  This isn't right. (stops walking) 
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  I know it doesn't look promising, but I swear this place is great. It's the 
  best kept secret in town. It's just right down this way. (they start walking 
  again)
BUFFY
  Well, it is one of the nicer dark alleys.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  I promise you, it's just a little bit further.
BUFFY
  OK...
  As they walk down the alley, a vampire steps out in front of them. Then 
    two more step up behind them, growling. Buffy starts fighting them immediately. 
    There's a horde of them now. She manages to punch them and kick them away 
    from her one by one until she has opportunity to get her stake out of her 
    purse. She stakes one, then another, then another.
BUFFY
  (to the Principal) You set me up, you son of a— 
  Buffy realizes that Principal Wood is also fighting off vampires. Without 
    her help. 
BUFFY
  (confused) What?
  Principal Wood overpowers one of the vampires and stakes him. Then knocks 
    the last one to the ground, staking him too. He flips the stake in his hand, 
    then returns it to his belt holster as he walks back to Buffy. 
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  (offers her a hand to help her stand) I guess we should talk.
  Fade to black.

LISSA
  And you still have to see her, like, everyday?
XANDER
  Yeah, but I guess that's good.
LISSA
  How is that a good thing? I mean, it seems like she never let you forget what 
  happened.
XANDER
  Well, it's on her mind a lot right now because our anniversary's coming up—I 
  mean, it would have been our anniversary. And maybe I shouldn't be allowed to 
  forget it. I did—it was a bad thing, and it hurt her real bad.
LISSA
  And if you'd gone ahead and married her, even though you had doubts, that would've 
  been better?
XANDER
  I guess not.
LISSA
  Sounds to me like, in the long run, you're both better off. (flirtatiously) 
  I know it turned out good for me, and that's what really matters, right?
XANDER
  (laughs, nods, looks into her eyes) I should have taken you on a nicer date

    Buffy and Principal Wood are sitting across from each other at a small table 
    in a very elegant, romantic restaurant. Principal Wood is talking to the waitress, 
    ordering from the menu.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  (to waitress) Thank you.
BUFFY
  This place is nice. How the hell did you do that?
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  (chuckles) I've had a little practice. Never took on two at once before, but 
  I have taken out a vamp here or there. And some demons.
BUFFY
  So, you're freelance?
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Hm... freelance— (nods) I guess that's a good way to put it.
BUFFY
  And you know who I am?
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  You're the slayer.
BUFFY
  Right. OK, um, so I'm guessing that you don't work in an office 15 feet above 
  the hell mouth because you enjoy educational administration?
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Well, I actually do enjoy the work, but yeah. Yeah, you're right. I maneuvered 
  myself into that school, that office—just like I maneuvered you there. The 
  hell mouth draws the bad things in close, and now we're headed for something 
  big, Buffy. Really big, and I need to be here when it happens. I want to help.
BUFFY
  So, y-you didn't hire me for my counseling skills?
PRINCIPAL WOOD
    (laughs heartily, then sees Buffy's hurt look; then straight-faced) They're 
    valuable too.
BUFFY
  Wh-why didn't you tell me about you?
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  I wasn't sure about things yet.
BUFFY
  Y-you didn't think you could trust me?
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  No, no. No, I wasn't sure I was ready yet—ready to jump into this fight.
BUFFY
  And now you are?
PRINCIPAL WOOD
    Well, now the fight is starting—or starting to start—and I don't 
    have time to worry anymore. I have to do something.
BUFFY
  So, you knew who I was before you even came here.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Yes.
BUFFY
  How? How do you know about slayers?
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Right. (nods) OK. See, when I was a little boy, my mother was one. The one, 
  actually—the slayer.
BUFFY
  Your mother— (sighs) Wow, I didn't know that any slayers had children.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Well, I don't know of any others. She was killed when I was four. I still remember 
  her, but it's a little...fuzzy? You know?
BUFFY
  (nervously) Um, something got her... a demon—?
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  A vampire. Oh, man, I went through this whole "avenging son" phase 
  in my twenties, but I never found him. So, now I just dust as many of them as 
  I can find. I figure, eventually I'll get him. That's probably why we got jumped 
  outside. I'm not very popular with the bumpy-foreheaded crowd, and I bet you 
  aren't either.
BUFFY
  (shakes head) No. Not most of them. Um, so, do you have any slayer powers? (giggles) 
  I'm sorry, I—I'm just so floored. I-I have no idea what to ask.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  No, I don't have powers. No super-strength or mythic responsibilities. I'm just 
  a guy with a few skills 'cause her watcher took me in and raised me.
BUFFY
  So, you decided to tell me?
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  That's right.
BUFFY
  In a darkened, little romantic French restaurant?
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Um, yeah...(nods) Yeah, I'm not really sure how that happened, but yeah.

JONATHAN/FIRST
  Did you find the gun?
  He's talking to Andrew, who steps forward into view holding a brown paper 
    bag folded over neatly at the top.
ANDREW
  Yes, it was in Buffy's underwear drawer. She has nice things.
JONATHAN/FIRST
  Show me.
ANDREW
  Well, I didn't take 'em, but there were thongs and regular underpants—
JONATHAN/FIRST
  (annoyed) Show me the gun.
ANDREW
  Oh. (opens paper bag and holds it out toward Jonathan/First) Here. (Jonathan/First 
  looks in the bag to see the gun at the bottom) Willow tried shooting Kennedy 
  with that.
JONATHAN/FIRST
  Great. There's gonna be panic and fleeing when you start firing, so you're gonna 
  have to get them trapped someplace like the basement.
ANDREW
  And we're killing them because...?
JONATHAN/FIRST
  Because they're the future of the slayer line. When they're gone, the line is 
  gone.
ANDREW
  Uh-huh, uh-huh. Um, so why not have Spike do it? He's the one with the trigger.
JONATHAN/FIRST
  It's not time for him yet. You can wait for the next time they're training in 
  the basement, but don't rely on a locked door to keep them in. You'll need more. 

ANDREW
  (nods) OK. (walks nervously toward the desk, leans against it) Say, um, do you 
  have any weaknesses I should know about if I'm gonna work for you, like, uh, 
  kryptonite or allergies?
JONATHAN/FIRST
  What are you asking?
ANDREW
    Oh, nothing, um... (nervously plays with items on the desk) Are you—are 
    you made out of the evil impulses of humans, so if everyone was unconscious 
    at the same time, you would fade away?
JONATHAN/FIRST
  You're asking a lot of questions.
ANDREW
  Yes, well, I, uh, because... 'cause I'm evil, and I want to do the best I can 
  at that, so I want to... (clears throat) know stuff like when—when do we kill 
  Buffy?

JONATHAN/FIRST
    (walks toward Andrew) You think you can trick the First? You think you could 
    squirm free? I hold you, Andrew. I made you do this... 
  Jonathan/First presses the palms of his hands against his shirt. They make 
    a squishy sound. He pulls his hands away palm-up to show Andrew they are smeared 
    with congealing blood.
JONATHAN/FIRST
  (softly) Jonathan suffered. He was your friend, and he trusted you, and now 
  he spends eternity in pain because of what you did.
ANDREW
  No. What's happening to you?
  Jonathan/First's body is deteriorating in front of Andrew's eyes as it progresses 
    slowly through the stages of decay. The skin is glistening and turning a greenish-brown 
    color.
JONATHAN/FIRST
  This is what you did to him. Took away everything he was and left him like this. 
  You started down a road with that action. You have to keep going.
ANDREW
  Stop looking like Jonathan. You're not him. You're the First, and you're trying 
  to get me to shoot innocent girls, but I won't do it. I'm good now. When the 
  fight is over, I'm gonna pay for killing Jonathan.
JONATHAN/FIRST
  (shakes his head) You're gonna pay for more than that. Do you know why? Because 
  the biggest, baddest First Evil in the world's angry with you.

XANDER
  See? I knew it.
LISSA
  Thanks for your help selecting the ropes. The one I picked wasn't strong enough.
XANDER
  Yeah, that would've been bad. Listen, is this because I'm friends with Buffy?
LISSA
  Who's Buffy?
XANDER
  The slayer.
LISSA
  You know the slayer?
XANDER

  the air) This can't just happen. It can't just keep happening that demon women 
  find me attractive. There's gotta be a reason.
LISSA
  You just seem like a nice guy, that's all. And I wanted to get to know you.

  it off?
KENNEDY
  Guess we succeeded pretty good, huh?
ANDREW
  God, I never should have gone in wired. (whiny) Redemption is hard.
GILES
  Getting back to Spike's question, why did you try to recall it?
ANDREW
  Ooh!
WILLOW
  To study it. To see if we could figure something out from what it was saying. 
  Because, guys, we have to face it, we know nothing about the First.
ANDREW
  Owie! Ow ow!
ANYA
  Well, we know not to record it. That's something.
SPIKE
    Why did it appear to this one, then? (gestures to Andrew) I thought it was 
    supposed to be pulling my strings.
ANDREW
  It said it wasn't time for you yet. (Dawn pulls off the last piece of tape) 
  Ow. I'm frightened. And my chest hurts where the tape was. (sits down)
DAWN
  It's OK, Andrew. You did good. You stood up to it. That's really amazing.
ANDREW
  Thank you. You're a peach.
ANYA
  Yeah. What did it want you to do, anyway?
ANDREW
  Shoot all the girls.
DAWN
  (worried) Shoot girls?
ANDREW
  Not you, just the potentials.
DAWN
  (relieved) Oh, well that's something, anyway. (covering for her relief, looks 
  around, sounding concerned again) Something tragic.
GILES
  This proves my point. This time is crucial. We should be circling the wagons 
  instead of doing things like going out on dates when—when gunplay is imminent. 
  Willow, call Buffy. Get her back here. We need to dispose of the gun and-and 
  figure out our next move.
SPIKE
  I'll go get her.
WILLOW
  I'll call. (a cell-phone rings in the background)
AMANDA
  Bet that's her. Sometimes you're thinking about calling someone—
WILLOW
  (looking at her phone) No, it's a text message. (reading) Oh, it's from Xander. 
  It's one of our signals.
AMANDA
  Signals?
WILLOW
  Yeah, the system we set up a while back. Like codes. Uh, this one's either "I 
  just got lucky, don't call me for a while" or "my date's a demon who's 
  trying to kill me."
KENNEDY
  You don't remember which?
WILLOW
  It was a long time ago.
DAWN
  Well, if we play the percentages...
GILES

SPIKE
  I'll go get her. (starts to go) 
WILLOW
    That's ok. (Spike sighs) We don't even know where she went. (a cell phone

    Calling." Willow picks up Buffy's phone from the table beside her.) That's

  Well, then you do understand. But, uh, what makes you think that's, like, a 
  good idea?
LISSA
  The end is coming. The final fight, and everyone is hearing the drumbeat. It's 
  telling us to pick our partners, align ourselves with the good or the evil. 

  Lissa reaches behind her to grab a long, thin knife. When she turns back 
    to face Xander, her eyes have changed to a yellow lizard-eyed look. She stabs 
    Xander in the belly.

PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Ten minutes. (Principal Wood watches the rear view mirror suspiciously) So,

    punching her and disarming her by knocking the knife from her hand.
XANDER
  Buffy!
  Buffy and Lissa are fighting when Spike enters the room. Lissa starts 
    whaling on Spike. She kicks Buffy away, knocking her to the ground. She pushes 
    Spike down and starts strangling him, bringing forth Spike's vampire facade. 
    Principal Wood sees Spike's face change.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  He's a vampire.
XANDER
  Oh, God! Hurry!
  Principal Wood stops staring at Spike and goes to aid Xander, cutting 
    the ropes that hold his hands to the wheel, but the seal is already beginning 
    to open. Across the room, Buffy knocks Lissa off of Spike. A Turok-Han is 
    reaching out of the seal as it opens, but Principal Wood escapes its grasp 
    as he finally gets Xander down from the wheel. The seal slams shut, cutting 
    off the arm of the Turok-Han that was reaching out. Principal Wood sets Xander 
    down against a wall. 
  Buffy and Lissa are still fighting, struggling over possession of a sword. 
    Lissa knocks Buffy across the room, but Buffy holds on to the sword. Spike 
    engages in fighting Lissa, but he's getting his butt kicked. Buffy pulls Lissa 
    away from Spike and cuts off Lissa's head with the sword. As her head is separated 
    from her body, Lissa's true form is revealed as a gruesome pinkish creature 
    with hairy shoulders and stitches all over its head and nasty black shark 
    teeth on its lipless jaws.
BUFFY

  Buffy goes to Spike's side to make sure he's all right. She holds Spike's 
    hand, but sees Principal Wood staring at them as she comforts him. She stands

  I'd need some stylish new clothes. 
GILES
  Enough! Have you learned nothing from tonight's assorted chaos? There isn't 
  time for fun and games and quips about orientation. (holds up flashcards) These—these 
  aren't a joke. (flips through the cards) This—this happens. Girls are going 
  to die. We may die. It's time to get serious. (walks out of the room)

  35     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Buffy's sitting on the couch alone in the living room. Spike walks in and 
    sits next to her.
SPIKE
  Did anybody tell you about what happened around here tonight?
BUFFY
  Willow did. The First is back in the mix.
SPIKE
  It, uh, it talked to the little boy. Said it wasn't time for me yet. I should 
  move out. Leave town before it is time for me.
BUFFY
  No, you have to stay.
SPIKE
  You've got another demon fighter now.
BUFFY
  That's not why I need you here.
SPIKE
  Is that right? Why's that then?
BUFFY
  'Cause I'm not ready for you to not be here.
SPIKE
  (looks at her a moment) And the Principal? How's he fit in? (Buffy looks at 
  him a moment, then Spike looks away)
  Cut to:
  36     INT.     BATHROOM 
    AT PRINCIPAL WOOD'S PLACE - NIGHT
    Principal wood is bent over the sink, rinsing out his mouth as he finishes 
    brushing his teeth. He stands upright to look in the mirror, only to see a 
    black woman with a 1970's afro hairstyle standing behind him smiling.
  WOMAN
  You look good.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  You're not my mother.
NIKKI/FIRST
  I give you a compliment, and you don't say thank you? Did I raise you that way?
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  You didn't raise me at all.
NIKKI/FIRST
  Well, I was dead.
  Principal Wood turns to face her, then walks straight through her. At the 
    door to the bathroom, he stops and turns to face her again.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  (crosses his arms) So, you're the First. Why are you here? Why now?
NIKKI/FIRST
  'Cause you've been coming up in the world—taking the demons out. It makes a 
  mother proud.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Yeah? (steps forward) Well, think how pleased she'll be when I help take you 
  out. Until it's time for that, I've got no use for you. (turns to walk away) 

NIKKI/FIRST
  Would you like to know who killed me? (Principal Wood stops in his tracks) I 
  know you went looking for him.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  (turns to face her) You don't know anything.
NIKKI/FIRST
    Is that right? Well, you can check it out after I tell you. Check the timing. 
    Re-read what the witnesses said, and the people in the subway station—
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Who is it?
NIKKI/FIRST
  You met him. You know him. You fought at his side.
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  Spike.
NIKKI/FIRST
  (smiles) Now, what do you say?
PRINCIPAL WOOD
  (looks down) Thank you.
