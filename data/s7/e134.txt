  RECAP: (Skip Recap...)
  GILES (V.O.)
    Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
  1     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    HOUSE - NIGHT
    Dawn's sitting on the living room floor in front of the couch, hugging a pillow, 
    amid the destruction from her earlier encounter. Willow comes to talk to her.
  WILLOW
    Dawn, what happened here?
  DAWN
    I saw Mom.
  WILLOW
    It's the Big Bad, Dawn. The one we knew was coming.
  2     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Spike hands and feet chained to the wall. He lunges at Buffy, who stares him 
    straight in the eyes.
  BUFFY
    (in his face) I believe in you, Spike. 
  Spike looks at her with a face full of hope and amazement. Just then, 
    the lights flicker and go out. Someone bursts into the basement and pushes 
    Buffy away from Spike. She falls to the ground.
  Cut to:
  3     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    HOUSE - NIGHT
    Robed men break into the house from all angles, smashing windows and breaking 
    down doors. Covered head to toe in long, black, hooded robes, these people 
    have batons and no eyes
  Cut to:
  4     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Buffy goes down the stairs to the basement, followed by Xander. She stops 
    dead in her tracks when she sees the empty shackles that Spike was supposed 
    to be in.
  BUFFY
    They were after Spike all along.
  Cut to:
  5     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT
    Spike is tied to the wheel-like construct with all four corners of his body 
    pulled in opposite directions. Spike's body has symbols carved into his chest. 
    Spike/First morphs into Buffy's form. A Harbinger cranks a wheel attached 
    to a mechanism that hoists the wheel Spike's tied to into the air. Spike is 
    now hanging from the wheel about ten feet from the ground, bleeding steadily 
    from his ritualized symbol-shaped cuts.
  BUFFY (V.O.)
    You know what we're up against. The First.
  BUFFY/FIRST
    Now, Spike, wanna see what a real vampire looks like?
  Spike's blood is falling on the Seal of Danthazar that's right below him. 
    It's pooling in the grooves and being absorbed into the seal. The seal starts 
    to glow. One by one, the pointed tips of the pentagram at its center fold 
    up, forming a pyramid. Light comes out from under it. The pyramid sinks into 
    the ground. The remaining pieces of the seal follow suit. A monster climbs 
    out wearing black leather. Pan up to show its horrible disfigured face. It's 
    bald with a distinct vampire forehead and brows and trademark fanged teeth. 
    It looks gaunt, with extremely hollow cheekbones. It raises its hands toward 
    the sky and looks around the room, growling menacingly.
  Cut to:
  6     EXT.     STREET 
    IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT
    The UberVamp has caught up to Buffy, grabbing her from behind and throwing 
    her into a concrete wall. She steps back, still standing, as the UberVamp 
    literally crawls up the wall to gain momentum and height to kick her in the 
    face, knocking Buffy to the ground. Then he kicks her in the head again before 
    grabbing her arm and throwing Buffy through a concrete block wall. The wall 
    crumbles down on top of her, the roof caves in, and there's blackness.
  GILES (V.O.)
    As Neanderthals are to human beings, the Turok-Han are to vampires—ferociously 
    powerful killing machines, as single-minded as animals. 
  Cut to:
  7     INT.     KITCHEN 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Buffy and Giles are in the kitchen talking to the three slayers in training, 
    who are already up and eating breakfast. 
  GILES
    They are the vampires that vampires fear. 
  Cut to:
  8     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    HOUSE - DAY
    Buffy opens the front door to leave, but sees Giles standing there on her 
    front porch when she opens it. Buffy goes to hug Giles, but is cut off when 
    three girls she's never met walk right into her house.
  MOLLY
    (in a Cockney British accent) Nice place. Bit of a mess. (walks inside 
    the house)
  Cut to:
  9     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Dawn's standing in front of the three girls Giles brought with him. The three 
    girls are lined up against the wall, and Dawn's inspecting them, arms crossed 
    in front of her. 
  DAWN
    They're all slayers?
  GILES
    Potential slayers. Waiting for one to be called. There were many more like 
    them all over the world, but, um, now there's just a handful, and they're 
    all on their way to Sunnydale.
  Cut to:
  10     EXT.     SUNNYDALE 
    BUS STATION - NIGHT
    A charter bus opens its doors, and a couple of people walk down the steps 
    to exit the vehicle. The last person to exit is a young African-American girl, 
    wearing denim overalls and carrying a backpack. She looks around.
  Cut to:
  11     INT.     WILLOW'S 
    BEDROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Kennedy is lying on the foot of the bed, with one arm bent at the elbow, propping 
    her head up on her hand, talking to Willow, who's on the floor in a sleeping 
    bag.
  KENNEDY
    Right. How many girls arriving this time?
  WILLOW
    Just one. But since Giles has the coven searching for other slayers in waiting, 
    I bet we'll be seeing a lot more soon enough.
  Cut to:
  12     EXT.     SUNNYDALE 
    BUS STATION - NIGHT
    When Rona looks up, she sees two black-robed, hooded, eyeless men, the bringers, 
    coming toward her with knives in their hands. She backs up against the wall, 
    panicked and breathing heavily, and sinks down to the ground. Just then, the 
    pair of bringers between the buses is lifted off the ground and goes flying 
    apart, revealing Buffy, who had thrown them to the ground. Buffy walks up 
    to Rona, who is still cowering on the ground.
  BUFFY
    Rona, right? (Rona nods) 
  RONA
    (takes Buffy's hand, stands) You're her!
  Cut to:
  13     INT.     DINING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Willow is talking to Buffy and Xander.
  WILLOW
    Another potential arrived in town the day before yesterday. 
  Cut to:
  14     EXT.     SUN 
    SPOT MOTEL - DAY
    Buffy and Xander walk up to Room 25.
  Cut to:
  15     INT.     SUN 
    SPOT MOTEL - DAY
    Buffy kicks the door in and enters, followed by Xander. She sees a girl lying 
    on the floor, face down in a pool of blood. Buffy kneels to touch her, and 
    looks back up at Xander.
  BUFFY
    She's cold. Been dead for days.
  XANDER
    Poor kid. She made it all the way to Sunnydale just to get herself killed. 
    (Buffy rolls the girl over)
  BUFFY
    (looks at the girl's face) Eve.
  XANDER
    Eve, who's in our house?
  Buffy and Xander stare at each other, wide-eyed and incredulous.
  Cut to:
  16     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Buffy rushes down the stairs to the basement.
  BUFFY
    Get away from them.
  DAWN
    Buffy, what did Eve do?
  XANDER
    That's not Eve.
  All the girls stand and back away from Eve. Eve stands and faces Buffy.
  EVE/FIRST
    One more down. Oh, well, can't save 'em all, can ya, Buffy? Bye.
  Eve disappears in a flash of light (like a television being turned off).
  Cut to:
  17     EXT.     CONSTRUCTION 
    SITE - NIGHT
    Buffy's fighting the Turok-Han. The Turok-Han pushes her into the wall of 
    the construction office trailer. Buffy falls to the ground. Buffy keeps going 
    and finally injures and overpowers it. Buffy grabs some nearby barbed wire 
    and slips it around the Turok-Han's throat. It falls to the ground, and Buffy 
    pulls on the wire hard enough to sever its head. The Turok-Han explodes in 
    a cloud of dust in front of her. 
  BUFFY
    (to the slayers-in-training) I don't know what's coming next, but I do know 
    it's gonna be just like this. Painful. Believe it, we'll be the ones left 
    standing. 
  Cut to:
  18     INT.     UNDERGROUND 
    CAVE - NIGHT
    Still shackled to the rocky cave wall, Spike sees someone walking toward him. 
    White-shirted, but and bruised Buffy is standing before him holding a bringer's 
    knife in her hand. Buffy approaches him slowly and cuts him loose of his chains. 
    He collapses forward and catches himself, bracing with his hand on her shoulder. 
    When he touches her and realizes she's real, he smiles and squints, searching 
    her face. She looks into his eyes, tapping an emotional connection between 
    them.
  SPIKE
    You. Oh. 
  He puts his arm around her, and she puts her arm around his waist. Although 
    Spike is weak and limping, they walk out of the cave together. 
  Fade to black.
  End Recap.
    
     
  
    The Start Of Episode
  
  PROLOGUE:
  19     EXT.     SUNNYDALE 
    CEMETERY - NIGHT
    Rona and Vi are walking through the cemetery nervously, holding stakes, being 
    as quiet as they can be. 
  Something behind them steps on a branch and makes a cracking sound, and 
    the girls turn to look. It's Spike—in vampire visage. He punches Rona 
    to the ground. Vi tries to stake him, but Spike catches her hand and grabs 
    her, and twists her arm behind her back. He puts his arm around her throat, 
    growls and goes to bite her neck. Vi screams. Spike stops before biting her, 
    looks up, and lets his vamp face fade away. Vi squeaks with fright. Still 
    holding her, he looks up, and talks to people in front of him.
  SPIKE
    OK, these two are dead. Why?
  RONA
    (stands, dusts herself off, to Spike) 'Cause the black chick always gets it 
    first?
  VI
    (to Spike) Ow!
  BUFFY
    What was that, Rona?
  RONA
    I'm dead because he's a vampire. I don't have slayer strength, slayer speed—i-it 
    wasn't a fair fight.
  SPIKE
    (still holding his arm to her neck) Vi, do you think I care about a fair fight?
  VI
    (tentatively) No, no sir. You don't play by the rules, and I have learned 
    a valuable lesson of some sort. (Spike twists her arm behind her back) Ow!
  BUFFY
    OK, Spike. (he lets Vi go; she walks up to Molly and Kennedy who are standing 
    near Buffy) You're right. You don't have slayer strength. But that doesn't 
    mean that you're not strong. You have inherent abilities that others do not 
    have.
  MOLLY
    (taking notes on a pad) Not like you do.
  BUFFY
    No, not yet, but it's there. You have the potential. You have strength, speed, 
    instinct. You just have to learn to trust yourself. Rona, what did your instincts 
    tell you to do just then?
  RONA
    (half-heartedly) Block his attack, keep him off balance, gain the advantage...?
  BUFFY
    No, they didn't.
  RONA
    (frankly) They told me to run.
  BUFFY
    Vi?
  VI
    (rubbing her wrist) They told me to run. They're still sort of telling me 
    to run.
  BUFFY
    Don't fight on his terms. Your gut's telling them to run, run. OK? Regain 
    the higher ground. Make the fight your own. Spike, what did your instincts 
    tell you to do just then?
  SPIKE
    Hunt. Kill. 
  BUFFY
    (walks out in front of the girls) Come at me, (Spike raises his eyebrows and 
    smiles a little) full speed. (to slayers-in-training) He needs to kill to 
    live. That tells you everything you need to know. 
  Spike growls and lunges at Buffy. She ducks, and he ends up lunging face-first 
    into a headstone. He falls to the ground, lying flat on his back, and Buffy 
    straddles him, holding one hand to his throat and pointing a stake above his 
    heart with the other.
  BUFFY
    (to slayers-in-training) Instinct. Understand his, but trust yours. You were 
    chosen for a reason. (Spike groans softly, to Spike) Are you OK? (lets go 
    of his throat)
  SPIKE
    I'm... fine. (tries to sit up) Couple of ribs ain't quite set right since— 
    I'm fine.
  BUFFY
    Lemme see. (lifts up his shirt a little to inspect his ribs)
  SPIKE
    No, it's just—
  BUFFY
    (sweetly, concerned) Spike. (touches his skin)
  SPIKE
    (reaches for her hand, holds it) I'm gonna be OK.
  RONA
    That's hot.
  MOLLY
    (still taking notes) So, we're supposed to, like, make out with them or something?
  VI
    (still rubbing her wrist and holding a stake) Careful, Buffy. Just when you 
    think it's part of the lesson, he'll (gestures to her hurt wrist) hurt your 
    arm.
  BUFFY
    (stands, offers her hand to Spike, helps him stand) Molly, Kennedy, let's 
    go. You're up. Next lesson.
  Fade to black.
  Opening credits.
  ACT I:
  20     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Buffy, carrying a battle-axe, is pacing back and forth disapprovingly in front 
    of the girls while they chatter. Rona and Kennedy are talking, and Molly and 
    Vi are talking. Dawn's sitting on the stairs, watching them through the stair 
    rail.
  RONA
    No way. One armed pushups are bull. 
  KENNEDY
    I can do 'em. I can do the kinda way you clap between.
  RONA
    I'm more of a chin up kinda girl. I can do chin-ups 'til the cows come home.
  VI
    You're saying demon, and I don't mean to ... Oh, bananas! Imagine yourself 
    covered in human viscera.... (Molly and Vi giggle and squeal as they continue 
    talking)
  Buffy stops pacing and hurls the battle-axe at the bull's-eye target hung 
    on the wall. The axe point lands in the center, a perfect bull's-eye. Everyone 
    stops talking and looks at her, a little frightened. She glares at them sternly.
  BUFFY
    You're all gonna die. But you knew that already. (paces in front of them) 
    'Cause that's the cool reward for being human. Big dessert at the end of the 
    meal. Don't kid yourselves, you guys. This whole thing is all about death. 
    (stands still) You think you're different 'cause you might be the next slayer? 
    Death is what a slayer breathes, what a slayer dreams about when she sleeps. 
    Death is what a slayer lives. My death could make you the next slayer. (walks 
    back to retrieve her axe from the target) Oh, goody. Rapt attention. I love 
    that so much. (pulls out the axe) Now, where was I? Ah. (sets down the axe, 
    walks back to the front) If we go with what Anya's resources are telling us, 
    then The First is in remission for a while, which we think means advantage 
    us.
  RONA
    Well, what does that mean? About The First?
  BUFFY
    (crosses her arms) As best we can tell, he—or precisely "it"—was 
    putting a lot of stock in that UberVamp thing, the Chaka Khan.
  DAWN
    (from the stairs) Turok-Han?
  BUFFY
    (doesn't acknowledge Dawn, pacing) So when I kicked its ass, the whole Firsty 
    circus decided to back off for a while. Good news? Means we probably don't 
    have to worry about it pulling Spike's strings for a while. (stands still) 
    Here's the half-empty. Time away means time to regroup. And part of that regrouping 
    is coming back stronger than ever. The odds are against us. Time is against 
    us. And some of us will die in this battle. Decide now that it's not going 
    to be you. (walks closer to the girls) I know you're all tired, far away from 
    home, anxious. But you're all special. Most people in this world have no idea 
    why they're here or what they want to do. You do. You have a mission, a reason 
    for being here. You're not here by chance. You're here because you are the 
    chosen ones. (turns, walks upstairs, commenting on the way) Dawn, you better 
    hurry up and eat something so you're not late for school.
  Cut to:
  21     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    CUBICLE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Buffy's sitting at her desk, talking on the telephone in her cubicle. 
  BUFFY
    Xander, I know. I'm sorry—If you're gonna take a shower at my house, 
    lock the door. Of course they're curious. (a student walks up to her cubicle, 
    Buffy gestures and mouths "oh, come in") Hey, I gotta go. Uh, has 
    Giles checked in yet? (Amanda sits in a chair across from Buffy) I thought 
    he was picking up that Chao-Ahn girl in Shanghai yesterday. OK, well, uh, 
    let me know if he does. Bye. (hangs up, sighs) Amanda, right? I'm all yours.
  AMANDA
    Do people ever think you're weird?
  BUFFY
    Um, (flutters eyelashes, shrugs) I guess. Sure, in a charming, endearing, 
    loveable... Yeah.
  AMANDA
    I feel like people think I'm weird, and so they pick on me. But I might be—weird.
  BUFFY
    (chuckles) Amanda, why do you think that you're weird?
  AMANDA
    One of the boys who picks on me, I kind of—See, if a guy picks on you, 
    is it weird to think he's cute?
  BUFFY
    (grins uncomfortably, leans back in her chair) Oh.. (sighs)
  AMANDA
    It's just, the last few times I've seen him, I've wanted to, you know, pick 
    on him....extra. More.
  BUFFY
    (stifles a laugh) Uh-huh.
  AMANDA
    The thing is, I can't tell. My mom says when a guy teases you, it means he 
    likes you.
  BUFFY
    (nods) Sometimes that's true.
  AMANDA
    Is it weird? We're mean to each other, and we like each other.
  BUFFY
    Well, it depends. Sometimes that's how people relate. Being mean to each other. 
    Even mortal enemies— (increasingly emphatic) Then with the— And 
    that leads to no good, absolutely no good. And much confusion. A-and then 
    it's over. Absolutely, seriously, definitely over. And that's confusing too. 
    The over part. Which it is. Over! (catches herself, calms a bit) So, maybe.
  Amanda looks somewhat confused. Buffy smiles.
  Cut to:
  22     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Buffy comes home through the front door only to find Vi and Rona in a loud 
    discussion with Xander. Andrew's also in the room. Xander appears to be chastising 
    the girls and gesturing emphatically to the destruction that surrounds him. 
    The cushions and chairs are on the floor, furniture is broken—even the 
    pictures on the walls are crooked.
  XANDER
    ...there might be an appropriate place to do that, like maybe outside. 
  ANDREW
    (yelling) Why do we always have to yell?
  BUFFY
    (crosses her arms and scowls) I was only gone a couple of hours.
  WILLOW
    (walks in from the dining room) Buffy?
  BUFFY
    (cocks her head and smirks at the arguers) Oh, look everybody. It's Willow. 
    Perhaps with a blunt weapon of some sort.
  WILLOW
    Buffy, we just got news. (turns back to the dining room, Buffy follows)
  Cut to:
  23     INT.     DINING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Buffy, Xander, Willow, and Anya are gathered around the dining room table. 
    Andrew is standing behind Xander, and Dawn is leaning on a door jamb.
  BUFFY
    And she's sure?
  WILLOW
    Positive. Althenea said the seers located another potential slayer here in 
    Sunnydale. Someone that already lives here.
  BUFFY
    (sighs) Oh, God...
  ANYA
    All these girls flocking to town, and this one's already here and under our 
    noses?
  XANDER
    Wait, the seers couldn't find out her name or, like, her address or anything? 
    Am I getting the definition of seer wrong?
  BUFFY
    I was gonna take the girls out tonight, a little show and tell, but maybe 
    now I shouldn't.
  ANDREW
    They were so excited. (softly) You're gonna break their little hearts.
  BUFFY
    This town is lousy with Bringers. I don't want to risk that they find this 
    new girl first.
  WILLOW
    No, you should go. I can do a spell to find her tonight. I just have to get 
    together a few ingredients. But you-you shouldn't skip your training, it's 
    too important.
  BUFFY
    (looks at Willow) You think you can handle it?
  XANDER
    No problemo.
  DAWN
    (fidgets in the doorway) Yeah, and you guys have more important things to 
    do.
  BUFFY
    (doesn't acknowledge Dawn) OK, I'll take 'em.
  ANDREW
    (pumps his fist) Yes!
  BUFFY
    Andrew, (shakes head) you're not going.
  Andrew grunts softly as his expression deflates into a pout.
  Cut to:
  24     INT.     KITCHEN 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Molly, Vi, and Rona are going through the pile weapons that are laid out on 
    the island countertop.
  MOLLY
    (picks up a crossbow) Ooh, crossbow! Got to love it. (points it around the 
    kitchen) Feels like I'm storming a castle.
  RONA
    You do a lot of that, do you?
  MOLLY
    I might, I had a beauty like this. (Dawn walks into the kitchen, Molly points 
    the crossbow at her) Halt!
  DAWN
    OK, see, that's why we don't point the weapons in the kitchen.
  VI
    It's not loaded.
  DAWN
    That's always the lead quote under the headline "Household Crossbow Accident 
    Claims Teen".
  VI
    Oh, a mace! (picks up a mace)
  DAWN
    (rolls her eyes) Yeah, that's better.
  RONA
    (picks up a stake) Gotta go with the stake. It's classic. I like the feel 
    of wood in my hand.
  KENNEDY
    (walks into the kitchen) Lost me there. (sees the pile of weapons) Hey, we 
    gearing up already?
  DAWN
    Oh, right. You guys are going on your little group patrol.
  VI
    More than that, it's an outing.
  KENNEDY
    (picks up a dagger, smiling) I'm thinking tonight we might actually get to 
    kill things.
  DAWN
    I-I've killed things sometimes.
  Buffy walks into the kitchen, followed by Andrew.
  ANDREW
    (whining) I'm not begging.
  BUFFY
    You're like a small dog dancing for Snausages.
  ANDREW
    You don't want me coming along 'cause you think I'm evil.
  VI
    He doesn't seem evil, exactly.
  BUFFY
    (crosses her arms) He's not evil, but when he gets close to it, he picks up 
    its flavor like a mushroom or something.
  ANDREW
    But I'm reformed. I'm like Vegeta on Dragonball Z. I used to be a pure 
    Sayan, and now I fight for the side of Goku.
  BUFFY
    (shakes her head) Still not coming.
  ANDREW
    (whining) It's not fair. Spike just killed people, and he gets to go. 
  BUFFY
    Spike didn't have free will and you did.
  ANDREW
    (sighs) I hate my free will.
  SPIKE
    (enters the kitchen) This is where you're all hiding. You ready to go, or 
    what? (the girls greet him)
  BUFFY
    Let's go, girls. Grab your weapons. 
  Rona, Vi, Kennedy and Molly each grab a weapon and follow Buffy and Spike 
    out of the house.
  RONA
    All right. Let's do it. I don't know about you guys, but I'm ready to kick 
    some serious....
  ANDREW
    (to Dawn) You wanna play Dragonball Z? (Dawn just glares at him)
  Cut to:
  25     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Willow, Dawn, and Andrew are gathered around the coffee table, taking inventory 
    of Willow's spell ingredients.
  WILLOW
    OK, I got my tumbleweed, my eggs...got my chrysalises—chrysali? My butterfly 
    transformer pods. Hey, wh-where's my snakeskin?
  ANDREW
    (holding the snakeskin as if it were a live snake and hissing) At your ssssservice, 
    Miss Rosenberg, ssssir. (Willow stares disapprovingly, Andrew hands the skin 
    to her) Can you imagine if every once in a while, people just wriggled out 
    of their skin and left it behind them like—like on the sidewalk. Talk 
    about embarrassing.
  DAWN
    (to Willow) Hey, do you think this girl, this potential, goes to Sunnydale?
  WILLOW
    Hmm. Well, I guess probably, huh? I mean, she's got to be about that age.
  DAWN
    Could be anybody. Could be that glamazon in gym class, what's her name? Oh, 
    my lab partner, Margot, the freak. Boy, I hope not, because she totally fainted 
    right in the middle of our fetal pig dissection. Somehow I just don't think 
    she's cut out for the slayage biz.
  ANDREW
    (pained) Killing pigs is just so wrong. (nods knowingly) And also hard. (Dawn 
    looks at him funny)
  WILLOW
    Well, we'll know soon enough who the next potential is. Somebody's life is 
    about to change.
  DAWN
    How long will it take? Will we find out who it is right away?
  WILLOW
    Pretty much. The spell will conjure up this brilliant light, a-and the light 
    will find the potential and it'll illuminate her with a glowing aura.
  ANDREW
    Cool.
  WILLOW
    I've enchanted this map (gestures to a map on the coffee table) so we can 
    track her basic location. We'll have to hot-foot it, but I'm betting we find 
    her tonight.
  DAWN
    You know, if it is Margot, she's so gonna faint.
  Later now, Willow is sitting in front of the lit fireplace. She's got 
    a mortar and pestle on the hearth and her ingredients are laid out. Dawn, 
    Anya and Xander are also in the room. As she recites the spell, Willow throws 
    each item she mentions into the fire.
  WILLOW
    To light the aura of the new, skin of snake and chrysalis too. 
    To indicate the fresh reborn, tumbleweed and rosebush thorn. 
    An egg that means the life to come. 
    Take this, oh spirit, and my spell is done.
  As Willow finishes the spell recitation, an orange haze emanates from 
    the fireplace. Everyone in the room wrinkles up their noses and starts coughing.
  XANDER
    Oh, good God, what is that smell?
  ANYA
    (covering her nose with her hand) I'm fairly sure that's the smell of a hardboiled 
    egg being thrown into a fire.
  XANDER
    Uh-huh.
  WILLOW
    (covering her mouth and nose with her hand) The smell will lead us to the 
    potential.
  XANDER
    Or some poor soul who ate too many chimichangas.
  WILLOW
    She'll also be lit with a brilliant aura. 
  The orange haze from the fire has gathered in the center of the room, 
    making a mass of glowing light. Willow, Anya, Dawn and Xander are standing 
    in a circle almost, and the light is moving around in the middle of their 
    circle.
  DAWN
    Is it supposed to be shimmying all over like that?
  WILLOW
    I don't know. I don't think so.
  ANYA
    So you messed up the spell again. At least it smells, you know, other-worldly. 
    (Willow looks at her, hurt. Anya realizes this and changes the subject, pointing 
    to the light) Oh, look, pretty.
  WILLOW
    I suck. I'm sorry, you guys, I— Maybe we could figure something out on 
    the computer?
  DAWN
    Good call. I'm gonna open the door and let this place air out. (waves at the 
    air in front of her as she walks to the front door)
  XANDER
    (walks up to Willow, puts his arm around her) Don't worry, Will. It's really 
    no big.
  WILLOW
    I just—I was sure that it was gonna work. 
  Suddenly, the mass of light congeals and forms into a solid beam and heads 
    straight for Dawn.
  WILLOW
    Dawn! 
  The light hits Dawn with such a force that it picks her up and pins her 
    to the door. The light goes straight into her, then she drops to the ground, 
    her chest still glowing orange. Somewhat disoriented, Dawn looks at Willow, 
    Xander, and Anya with wide eyes.
  WILLOW
    (staring at Dawn) I think it worked.
  Fade to black.
  ACT II:
  26     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Resume. Dawn collapses at the door. 
  XANDER
    (goes to her side) Dawn! 
  WILLOW
    (Willow and Anya step forward) Dawn, are you OK?
  DAWN
    (stands, walks into the living room, the others follow) Maybe y-you did it 
    wrong? Was it a-ambiguous in any way? Did you maybe say potential sailors? 
    'Cause I-I do like the water.
  WILLOW
    I did it right.
  XANDER
    (staring at her) Wow, she—you're a potential. You could be the next slayer.
  DAWN
    (eyes growing wider) Whoa. (goes to sit on the sofa)
  ANYA
    (kneels in front of her) Wow, it's like one second you were this klutzy teenager 
    with fake memories and a history of kleptomania, and then—then suddenly 
    you're a hero, a hero with a much abbreviated lifespan.
  XANDER
    This is huge. We have to think about this.
  DAWN
    I-I can't think about this. (stands, paces) It doesn't fit in my head.
  WILLOW
    A slayer. Makes sense, I guess. Remember that thing about they share the same 
    blood or whatever?
  ANYA
    (shrugs) Yeah, I never got that. 
  DAWN
    She has to die. (sits on a chair) I mean, if I was ever the slayer, it would 
    mean she died.
  ANYA
    Well, it's a lot like being the Pope in that way, except you don't have to 
    be some old Catholic.
  WILLOW
    I've got to call Buffy. She's gonna be so excited. (goes to the phone)
  XANDER
    (blocks her) No, we can't. She didn't bring a cell phone.
  DAWN
    Well, sure, 'cause all the important people are with her.
  XANDER
    (points to Dawn) You are important now.
  DAWN
    (stands) Wh-wha-what happens now?
  ANYA
    Well, you could start by maybe sitting still for a sec.
  DAWN
    (paces) I-I cant. I-I need to know what happens to my life.
  WILLOW
    Well, I guess Buffy trains you.
  DAWN
    Right, I train with the potentials—other potentials. Learn to do the 
    stuff they're learning.
  ANYA
    Right, we also have to protect you from the, uh, eyeless guys, the ones with 
    the sharp, sharp knives.
  DAWN
    Bringers.
  WILLOW
    It's OK, we'll protect you.
  DAWN
    (worried) What if they saw the spell?
  XANDER
    Saw the spell? Dawn, they can't see flashcards. Big ones. 
  DAWN
    (getting upset) We did a big orange powerful spell. What if they sensed it? 
    What if they're on their way?
  ANDREW
    (enters the room) Are we gonna replace the microwave? 'Cause I was thinking 
    some Orville Redenbacher with fresh butter flavor— What's going on?
  ANYA
    Dawn's gonna be a slayer.
  ANDREW
    Holy crap! (Xander gives him a look) Excuse me. Plucked from an ordinary life, 
    handed a destiny—
  XANDER
    (points at Andrew) Say Skywalker, and I smack ya.
  ANDREW
    Does Buffy know?
  XANDER
    She didn't take her phone.
  ANDREW
    Incommunicado.
  WILLOW
    Well, we'll tell her soon as she gets back.
  DAWN
    Let's not.
  WILLOW
    What? Dawn, she has to know.
  DAWN
    I-I know, just not right away. Guys, when mom appeared to me, she said—
  WILLOW
    Dawnie...
  DAWN
    No, please. She said something about Buffy, and I'm thinking... I'm just not 
    so sure Buffy will be happy for me.
  WILLOW
    Of course she will.
  DAWN
    Will she? I mean, I'm not even sure I'm happy for me. Everything's different 
    for me now.
  ANYA
    That's because you're a part of something larger. Like being swallowed. By 
    something larger.
  DAWN
    (stands) This-this is too much for my head again. (runs upstairs) I can't. 
    I—I need to be—
  XANDER
    Nice job with the "getting swallowed" analogy.
  ANYA
    Well, it is a mixed bag, you know. If she gets to be the slayer, then her 
    life is short and brutal. And if she doesn't, then it smells of unfulfilled 
    potential. My swallowed analogy looks pretty sweet right now, doesn't it?
  WILLOW
    It's not like that. It's like, she's part of this huge power. I know what 
    that feels like. It feels wonderful.
  ANDREW
    Yes, Willow so captured it. It's like—well, it's almost like this metaphor 
    for womanhood, isn't it? The sort of flowering that happens when a girl realizes 
    that she's part of a fertile heritage stretching back to Eve, and—
  XANDER
    (covers his face with his hands, then gestures to Andrew) I'll pay you to 
    talk about Star Wars again.
  ANYA
    This isn't about womany power. This is about the fact that Dawn just might 
    have bought herself an early death.
  WILLOW
    We don't know that.
  XANDER
    Right, all we know is that everything just changed.
   
    Cut to:
    26a     INT.     DAWN'S 
      ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
      From the door to her room, Dawn listens to the others argue downstairs.
    WILLOW (O.S.)
      Someone should go find Buffy. I still think she needs to know.
    XANDER (O.S.)
      Hey, Will, what if she doesn't like it?
    WILLOW (O.S.)
      Are you worried about what Dawn said? About the ghost? Xander, we don't 
      even know if that really was Joyce. And we don't know what she meant about 
      Buffy.
  
  Cut to:
  XANDER
    I'm not talking about that. I mean, what do you think Buffy's going to do 
    with this information? Jump up and down? Teach Dawn the secret handshake? 
    She know what this means.
  ANYA
    Short, brutal life. Sharp, sharp knives. I covered this.
  XANDER
    Right. You think Buffy really wants that for Dawn? And besides, Dawn doesn't 
    want us telling her yet.
   
    Cut to:
    26b     INT.     DAWN'S 
      ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
      Dawn walks to her mirror and stares while listening to the others talk downstairs.
    WILLOW (O.S.)
      Dawn's freaking out. Her input—not worth that much right now.
    ANYA (O.S.)
      She's a child. Of course she can't handle this.
    XANDER (O.S.)
      Hey, something out there says she can handle this and a hell of a lot more. 
      Something out there chose her.
    DAWN
      I'm chosen.
    WILLOW (O.S.)
      Sure, she can handle it. Is that why she's hiding out in her room right 
      now?
    XANDER (O.S.)
      She's just getting used to it. Let it happen. She doesn't have to rush.
  
  Cut to:
  ANYA
    He's right. We shouldn't rush her. Rushing's only gonna get her killed.
  
    Cut to:
    26c     INT.     DAWN'S 
      ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
      Dawn opens her bedroom window and climbs out.
  
  Cut to:
  27     INT.     DEMON 
    BAR - NIGHT
    Buffy and Spike lead the slayers-in-training into the demon bar. The place 
    is dimly lit, filled with disgusting-looking patrons that could never be mistaken 
    for humans. As Buffy and crew walk in, some of the patrons turn to look at 
    them as the young girls gawk at what they see.
  RONA
    (laughs) This is a bar.
  KENNEDY
    (grinning widely) Best damn field trip I ever took.
  MOLLY
    Look, they're all—
  VI
    (incredulous) They're demons! It's a demon bar. It's like a gay bar, only 
    with demons.
  One of the patrons at the bar stands and greets Spike. In appearance, 
    this demon is reminiscent of a walrus with smaller teeth and long droopy warts 
    dangling from its face.
  DEMON
    Spike! Long time. Nice of you to bring snacks.
  SPIKE
    Thouch them, and lose your privates.
  VI
    I didn't like him.
  SPIKE
    Nice job of blending in, girls.
  RONA
    We're a bunch of 15 year olds in a demon bar. How much blending did you think 
    we were gonna do?
  BUFFY
    Look, it's ok. Ususally you come to a place like this, you wanna be seen. 
    You wanna scare someone, or make contact—-
  MOLLY
    (eagerly) Or have a strong drink?
  BUFFY
    Not usually that.
  KENNEDY
    You don't drink?
  BUFFY
    Sure I do. I mean, no. That would be wrong.
  VI
    Do they card?
  BUFFY
    Nope, go ahead. (the girls walk up to the bar) Down all the yak urine shots 
    or pigs blood spritzers you like. (Spike smirks)
  VI
    Gross. (the girls back away from the bar)
  SPIKE
    Got that right. Prices they charge, you could get human blood straight from 
    the body. (Molly stares at him) Vampire...
  BUFFY
    Look, if I come here, it's 'cause I gotta wring some information out of something 
    large, scary, drunk, with a room full of friends who don't care much for the 
    slayer. Remember that. Not a being in here wouldn't be glad to rip your throat 
    out.
  CLEM
    (walks up to Buffy while she's talking to the girls) Buffy? Girl, how ya been?
  BUFFY
    (taken aback) Clem! (gets a good look at him) You look great, so toned. (they 
    hug)
  KENNEDY
    (under her breath, to Rona) He's ripping out her throat right now.
  CLEM
    (to Buffy) Oh, my God! It is so good to see you! I saw this great show on 
    the History Channel the other night that I knew you would love, and then something 
    went all flooey with my TiVo.
  BUFFY
    You know what? Can I talk to you for a second over here? 
  Buffy and Clem step away from the group, and Buffy whispers something 
    in Clem's ear.
  KENNEDY
    (under her breath, to Rona) You think she dated him too?
  Buffy and Clem rejoin the group.
  BUFFY
    OK, everyone. These are the girls. 
  CLEM
    Howdy. So, you girls are gonna deal with demons, huh? Just lemme tell you 
    this.
  Clem leans in as if to whisper something to them, and the girls crowd 
    around, following suit and leaning in. Then Clem does something with his face 
    that makes the girls scream and jump back with fright. From behind, it looks 
    as though his ears spin, and snakes jump out of his face.
  VI
    I could use a shot of that yak urine right about now.

  28     EXT.     NEIGHBORHOOD 
    STREET IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT
    Dawn's walking down the street alone, arms crossed and looking at the ground. 
    Then she hears someone approaching down the sidewalk. She looks up. It's Amanda 
    walking toward her.
  DAWN
    Hey.
  AMANDA
    Hey, Dawn. Whatcha doing?
  DAWN
    (shrugs) Uh, just walking. You?
  AMANDA
    Um, yeah, just walking too. K, well, have a good walk. I guess I'll see you 
    Monday morning?
  DAWN
    Yeah.
  They walk past each other, still going in opposite directions, then Amanda 
    turns to Dawn.
  AMANDA
    You all right?
  DAWN
    Sure. Just walking, you know? (looks closely at Amanda's face) A-are you all 
    right? (points to her own forehead) You've got a thing.
  AMANDA
    (Amanda touches her head where there's a bloody gash above her eye, she laughs 
    nervously) I guess I— I had a bit of a— It's been a bizarre night.
  DAWN
    What happened? Who did that to you? 
  AMANDA
    (biting her nails) Uh, nobody...exactly. I don't think you'd exactly believe 
    me.
  DAWN
    Try me.
  AMANDA
    I-I was at school late because of, you know, Swing Choir, and I tore my sweater, 
    you know, the striped ones we wear. So I went to Home Sciences to sew it up.
  DAWN
    Uh-huh.
  AMANDA
    And by the time I was finished, the place was empty, so it was all echoy and 
    lonely. And then there was this guy—or thing. And it was—it scratched 
    me, and I kinda dodged it, and it kinda hit its head.
  DAWN
    What kind of thing? 
  AMANDA
    I don't know. It was messed up. In the face. 'Round here abouts. (runs her 
    finger between her brows, and down the bridge of her nose)
  DAWN
    And when it scratched at you, did it—was it scratching with its teeth?
  AMANDA
    Is it real? Was it really a vampire? I bet you think I'm crazy.
  DAWN
    I—I believe you.
  AMANDA
    Well, cool. The thing is, after it hit its head, I kinda freaked out. I trapped 
    it in a room, and it's still there, and now I don't know what to do.
  DAWN
    It's OK. This is totally dealable. Don't worry.
  AMANDA
    Well, I was thinking of getting your sister.
  DAWN
    You know something about my sister?
  AMANDA
    Well, I've heard people talking. A lot of 'em think she's some kind of high-functioning 
    schizophrenic. But I also heard that maybe—like, maybe she could help 
    with this kind of thing. Do you think we should go get her? 
  DAWN
    She's out. I'll take this one.
  Cut to:
  29     INT.     CLASSROOM 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT
    Dawn and Amanda climb into the school through classroom window. Dawn pulls 
    a muscle as she climbs over the window ledge.
  DAWN
    (yelps, rubs her back) Whew. I think I strained something. Maybe something 
    I'll need later in life. Uh…
  AMANDA
    Come on. The vampire's upstairs. Are you spooked out?
  DAWN
    No. I'm all right. I-I can do this. It's mostly instinct. I think.
  As they walk out, the window slams shut, scaring Dawn. She jumps and squeals, 
    but when she turns to see what it was, she is able to collect her cool. Dawn 
    and Amanda walk out into the hall.
  AMANDA
    So, if he scratched me with a tooth, am I—I'm not gonna turn into one, 
    am I?
  DAWN
    (shakes her head) Uh, only if he slashed open one of his own veins and led 
    you to drink deep of his blood.
  AMANDA
    Nope.
  DAWN
    Good. You're lucky he didn't hurt you way more than that.
  AMANDA
    Right. He can do that. (stops walking, turns to Dawn) So, I was thinking... 
    we don't have to kill the vampire, do we?
  DAWN
    What?
  AMANDA
    Just suppose he got out and was maybe like encouraged toward the gym while 
    the marching band was playing because the way they look down on the Swing 
    Choir. It might be, you know, funny. (Dawn stares in disbelief, Amanda chuckles) 
    I'm just saying.
  Cut to:
  30     INT.     HALLWAY 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT
    Dawn and Amanda walk up to a classroom door, and they both stop and stand 
    in front of it.
  DAWN
    Well, he didn't break down the door, anyway.
  AMANDA
    Yeah. Can they do that?
  DAWN
    They're very strong and, although they feel pain, they don't hold back because 
    of it.
  AMANDA
    Guess you're some kind of monster expert too?
  DAWN
    Let's just say it runs in the family. (takes a deep breath and then tries 
    the doorknob; it's unlocked, and the door swings open) I thought you said 
    it was locked. (peers into the classroom)
  AMANDA
    It was. It was here.
  DAWN
    (walks into the room) Amanda, it got out.
  Widen the shot to show Dawn and Amanda near the doorway and a growling 
    vampire suspending himself between two air ducts near the ceiling.
  Fade to black.
  ACT III:
  31     INT.     CLASSROOM 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT
    Resume. Dawn and Amanda are standing just inside the classroom door, looking 
    around the room.
  AMANDA
    Where'd it go?
  DAWN
    I dunno. But we have to get out of here.
  Right as Dawn reaches to close the door, the vampire drops from the ceiling 
    and rushes her. They struggle over the door as she tries to shut him inside 
    the room. Ultimately, they wrestle the door off its hinges, and Dawn and Amanda 
    run away screaming.
  Cut to:
  32     INT.     HALLWAY 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT
    Dawn and Amanda run down the hall, away from the vampire. They go down the 
    stairs and head for an exit door, but it's locked. They turn to try a different 
    route, but the vampire has already caught up to them, blocking them from escaping. 
    Dawn looks around, and spots the fire extinguisher. She runs up to it, breaks 
    the glass cabinet with her elbow, and reaches in for the extinguisher canister.
  AMANDA
    What are you doing?
  DAWN
    (fussing with the extinguisher mechanism) I can't remember, does it have to 
    be upside down or right side up to work? Which is it?
  The vampire approaches before Dawn can figure out how to work the fire 
    extinguisher, so she hoists up the huge metal canister and swings it at the 
    vampire's head, knocking him down. He gets up, and Dawn hits him again, throwing 
    the canister at him where he fell. Dawn and Amanda run down the hall away 
    from him and head back upstairs.
  Cut to:
  33     INT.     CRYPT 
    AT SUNNYDALE CEMETERY - NIGHT
    Holding up a flashlight and looking around, Buffy and Spike lead the slayers-in-training 
    inside a crypt.
  BUFFY
    A vampire is an animal. Sometimes they run in packs, sometimes alone. Who 
    can tell us where we are?
  RONA
    It's a nest.
  BUFFY
    How can you tell? (hands flashlight to Spike)
  KENNEDY
    Only a vamp could live like this.
  SPIKE
    Some, yeah. As a group, we're not known for our tasteful decor, but in all 
    fairness to the race, (looks around) this place is seriously lacking in style.
  BUFFY
    Thank you, Spike.
  SPIKE
    I'm merely saying...
  BUFFY
    He has a point. Vampires can live anywhere. Any way they want. Taste, fashions, 
    living conditions—they can vary. The animal inside, always the same. 
    (Spike looks at Buffy and frowns)
  MOLLY
    (to Spike) Where'd you live?
  SPIKE
    What, you mean before? (Molly nods) A crypt actually, but nicer. A bit more—I 
    don't know if posh is the right word, but it was more like—
  BUFFY
    Comfy.
  KENNEDY
    Excuse me? When did you find it comfy?
  BUFFY
    Moving on. (the girls try not to laugh) You want to stay alive, you have to 
    spot and identify a nest on site. Look around, all of you. Look for signs 
    that just last night maybe a dozen, two dozen vampires were right where we're 
    standing. Go ahead. 
  The girls reluctantly break up and start looking around the crypt.
  SPIKE
    (to Buffy) Work, work, work. This little excursion was just in danger of being 
    interesting.
  BUFFY
    You know what, Spike— (looks over to see the girls have gathered around, 
    inspecting something on the floor) Interesting is not a problem.
  RONA
    Buffy, I think we found something.
  MOLLY
    (stares with her mouth open, then) It's a body.
  BUFFY
    (walks over, kneels to take a look, pulls on its shoulder, then lets it go) 
    It's not a body. It's leftovers.
  The body starts to move, then growls as it looks back over its shoulder 
    at Buffy. It's a vampire now.

    Dawn goes into the room, followed by Amanda, then shuts the door.
  DAWN
    Help! We need to barricade this! (Amanda grabs a lab chair, but Dawn shakes 
    her off) Too small.
  Dawn goes for the 4' wide by 6' tall filing cabinet, and starts pulling 
    it toward the door. Amanda goes to help push.
  AMANDA
    Too big.
  They finally get the filing pushed up to the door, and with their backs 
    against it, they sink to the floor.
  DAWN
    Stay down.
  AMANDA
    Think we're safe?
  Just as the words cross her lips, the vampire starts trying to break into 
    the classroom. He growls at the door, opening it a little and pushing it against 
    the filing cabinet.

    Buffy, stake in hand, is having a face-off with the vampire while the girls 
    watch from behind her.
  BUFFY
    No one's safe. Not here, not ever. See this guy?
  KENNEDY
    B-but he was dead a minute ago.
  BUFFY
    That was a minute ago. Now... (punches him in the face) 
  VAMPIRE
    (angrily) Hey! 
  BUFFY
    ... he's the enemy.
  The vampire lunges at Buffy from across the room.

    Still sitting on the floor with their backs to the filing cabinet, and frightened, 
    Dawn and Amanda try to hold the cabinet against the door to keep the vampire 
    out.
  DAWN
    Amanda?
  AMANDA
    Yes.
  DAWN
    Listen.
  AMANDA
    I'm listening
  DAWN
    We're gonna get out of this. Both of us. Alive. (squeals in fright as the 
    vampire tries to get in) Alive! You believe me?
  AMANDA
    I believe you.
  DAWN
    Good. 'Cause I got a plan.

    The vampire Buffy's fighting rolls across the floor. Buffy walks slowly after 
    him, still with stake in hand, talking to the girls.
  BUFFY
    You can't think too much. Reacting's better. Could be the difference between 
    staying alive and that other thing.
  Buffy punches the vampire and drops the stake on the floor. They fight 
    hand-to-hand. Kennedy wants to come to Buffy's aid and join the fight, but 
    Spike holds her back.

  DAWN
    OK, this plan of mine, I'm not guaranteeing it'll work.
  AMANDA
    Better than mine about him eating the Marching Band. Besides, your plan'll 
    work. 
  DAWN
    In case you haven't noticed, I don't know what I'm doing here.
  AMANDA
    You're getting it done.
  The vampire finally breaks through the glass on the door, sending a shower 
    of shards onto the girls below. They get up and go away from the door as the 
    vampire knocks over the cabinet and enters the classroom.

        Buffy punches the vampire, and he lands on his back on a stone sarcophagus. 
          He tries to kick Buffy, but she grabs his foot and punches him in the

        it takes just one vampire to kill you. So you've got to know you can 
          take him. Know your environment. Know what's around you, and know how 
          to use it. In the hands of a slayer, everything is a potential weapon. 
          If you know how to see it. When you're fighting, you have to know yourself, 
          your brain, your body. Know how to stay calm, centered. Every move is 
          important, every blow's got to be part of your plan 'cause you make 
          that one mistake, and it's over. You're not the slayer. 
      
       
       
        The vampire is stalking Dawn between the chemistry lab desks. She 
          backs up as he approaches, and ducks between the desks. Amanda is cowering 
          quietly in a corner. Dawn grabs a lab chair and pushes it toward the 
          vampire, who is undeterred. Dawn grabs an empty flask and throws it 
          at the vampire; it breaks on his head. She throws another empty flask, 
          but he keeps coming. Then she finds another flask with something in 
          it, and throws it at him; it breaks on his chest and now there's smoke 
          coming from his body. As he flinches inspect himself, Dawn runs to the 
          front of the classroom where she grabs the flagpole with the California 
          state flag on it. She struggles to break the flagpole in half on the 
          edge of a lab desk, but finally does splinter it. She leaves the part 
          that the flag is on and starts swinging the jagged wooden pole at the 
          vampire a few times, then loses her balance and falls to the floor. 
          The vampire pounces on her.

      You're not a potential. You're dead. What do you know? Right 
        now, the only thing you know for sure is you got me.
       
      Buffy grabs her stake from the floor as the vampire leaps 
        toward her, kicking at her face. She ducks, then defends against his fists 
        as he comes at her. Finally, Buffy grabs him by his shoulders and throws 
        him to the back of the crypt as she stands near the doorway. 
    
  
  Buffy drops the stake and walks out of the crypt. She and Spike close 
    the doors, shutting the slayers-in-training inside with the vampire. The vampire 
    walks menacingly toward the girls, and their faces are full of fright.

    HALLWAY AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Willow knocks on Dawn's door. Xander and Anya are standing behind her.
  WILLOW
    Come on, sweetie, open up.
  ANYA
    Want me to kick down the door?
  XANDER
    Anya.
  ANYA
    (laughing) What? It'd be funny. Besides, she's been sulking in there forever. 
    (Xander tries the doorknob, which is unlocked) Oh.
  Willow, Anya, and Xander walk into Dawn's room.
  Cut to:

    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Willow, Anya, and Xander look around the room, but Dawn's not there.
  ANYA
    Crap. (notices the open window) Double crap.
  XANDER
    Gone. We got to find her before the Bringers do. 
  WILLOW
    I can do a locator spell, but we gotta hurry. And find Buffy.
  Xander, Willow, and Anya leave the room.
  Cut to:

    The vampire is attacking Dawn, pinning her down to the floor as she struggles 
    underneath him.
  DAWN
    (screaming) Help! Amanda, help me!
  AMANDA
    (frozen still in the corner where she hid) I can't!
  DAWN
    (the vampire's mouth is nearly on Dawn's neck now) Amanda! 
  Just then, Bringers burst in through the classroom's exterior windows. 
    The vampire sits back to see what's going on, and Dawn uses her feet to push 
    him away from her. The bringers walk past Dawn and go straight for Amanda.
  DAWN
    (screaming) No! You don't want her! (the Bringers hoist Amanda up by the arms, 
    Dawn's voice softens as her expression melts) You want me...
  Fade to black.
  ACT IV:
  44     INT.     CLASSROOM 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT
    Resume. Amanda's face is one of sheer horror as two Bringers have her by the 
    arms and a third comes at her with a knife. Dawn stands and lights a gas jet 
    on one of the tables nearest the Bringers, causing a brief explosion and knocking 
    them down. 
  DAWN
    (picks up the jagged broken flagpole) Amanda!
  Amanda runs away from the Bringers toward Dawn. The girls quickly run 
    out of the room into the hallway.
  Cut to:
  45     INT.     HALLWAY 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT
    Amanda and Dawn are running down the hallway. Dawn's still carrying the flagpole 
    shard. They stop running when they get to the top of the stairs.
  AMANDA
    (out of breath) What were those?
  DAWN
    Amanda, listen to me. Remember when you said I was special? Well, I'm not. 
    But the thing is, you are. This is your battle, Amanda.
  AMANDA
    (shaking her head) No, I can't.
  DAWN
    You can! You've got to. Look, I've got your back, but this is something you 
    have to do. It's something you were born to do. (Bringers have found them 
    and are approaching from the other end of the hall; Dawn hands Amanda the 
    flagpole) Here, this belongs to you.
  Amanda reluctantly takes the flagpole fragment from Dawn. From the bottom 
    of the stairs, Xander sees Dawn and Amanda talking. He climbs halfway up the 
    stairs and calls below him.
  XANDER
    Buffy, up here.
  Buffy and Spike follow Xander up the stairs toward Dawn and Amanda. As 
    the Bringers come toward Amanda, she uses the flagpole as a staff, knocking 
    them down and defending herself quite well. Dawn manages to stay out of the 
    way and avoid the crossfire. As Amanda knocks the Bringers down, Buffy and 
    Spike go after them on the stairs. 
  BUFFY
    (stabs a Bringer with his own knife, then to Spike) Here! (hands the knife 
    to Spike)
  Spike stabs another Bringer with the knife Buffy gave him. The vampire 
    that attacked Dawn and Amanda in the classroom is there now too, fighting 
    Amanda. She defends herself admirably with the flagpole before ultimately 
    pinning the vampire against the wall and staking him with it. Buffy walks 
    upstairs to the last Bringer that's still alive and breaks his neck. Amanda 
    turns to her, confused and perturbed.
  AMANDA
    (to Buffy) OK. One minute I'm in Swing Choir, and the next— What the 
    hell's going on? You tell me to come to you with problems. Turns out, a vampire 
    attacked me. Problem. So I go to your house, and when I get there, this orange 
    cloud hits me.
  DAWN
    (to Xander) She was at the doorway.
  AMANDA
    And I don't know if you're into the drugs, but that's not my deal, all right. 
    That cloud hit me, and I got a little dizzy and discombobulated. 
  DAWN
    It was Willow's spell. She's the potential slayer.
  Cut to:
  46     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Rona, Amanda, and Kennedy are sitting on the couch, talking with Molly, who's 
    on a chair, and Vi who is kneeling on the floor, near the coffee table; together 
    they form a circle.
  RONA
    I'm sure the vampire thought we were like, what, four helpless girls. And 
    then Vi—Vi actually yells, "We're just four helpless girls."
  VI
    That was part of my plan. (Kennedy rolls her eyes playfully at Vi)
  RONA
    When it all started going down, it was like we knew what we were doing. For 
    real.
  MOLLY
    (to Rona) Yeah, like when you dodged that first attack, and then cracked him 
    across the jaw.
  RONA
    Aw, no, no, no, no, no. (to Molly) See, I wouldn't have been able to do that 
    if you hadn't've pulled his legs out.
  VI
    I hurt his arm. (nods proudly) Yep. And an arm can be as lethal as a mouth.
  MOLLY
    (to Kennedy) When you staked him, seriously, the rush was like—
  KENNEDY
    (to Amanda) So you took one out solo?
  MOLLY
    Yeah, what was that like? 
  AMANDA
    I don't know. I mean, when I saw the vampire, vamp—
  KENNEDY
    Vampire's good too.
  AMANDA
    Cool. Yeah, when that vampire attacked me, I felt this kind of charge, you 
    know?
  Dawn's standing on the periphery of the room, watching them talk. Her 
    arms are crossed and she's pouting a little.
  KENNEDY (O.S.)
    Like you realize in one instant that your whole life is different.
  AMANDA (O.S.)
    Exactly. It's that rush you're talking about. 
  BUFFY
    (walks up to Dawn from the kitchen, followed by Xander) Hey. (Dawn turns to 
    face her, puts on a happy face) You OK? 
  DAWN
    (nods) Yeah, I was thinking of hitting the books. Do some research on The 
    First. It's in retreat mode right now, but you're still gonna need to know 
    how to fight it.
  BUFFY
    (nods) Great. Sounds good. (to the slayers-in-training) Hey, you guys, wanna 
    head downstairs? Get our newest arrival up to speed?
  The girls all stand and follow Buffy out of the room. As each slayer-in-training 
    passes by Dawn, they don't look at her, don't acknowledge her at all, until 
    Amanda walks by. Amanda pauses for a second and looks at Dawn, smiles, and 
    then continues to follow the other girls. After the girls have gone, Dawn 
    sits down at the desk, opens a book and starts to read it. Then she notices 
    that Xander hasn't left the room but is standing behind her, watching her.
  DAWN
    (looking over her shoulder, to Xander) What's up?
  XANDER
    (walks into the room) Aw, I'm just thinking about the girls. It's a harsh 
    gig, being a potential. Just being picked out of a crowd, danger, destiny, 
    (grins) plus if you act now, death.
  DAWN
    They can handle it.
  XANDER
    Yeah. (sits in a chair in front of the desk) They're special, no doubt. The 
    amazing thing is, not one of them will ever know, not even Buffy. 
  DAWN
    Know what?
  XANDER
    How much harder it is for the rest of us. 
  DAWN
    No way. They've got—
  XANDER
    Seven years, Dawn. Working with the slayer. Seeing my friends get more and 
    more powerful. A witch. A demon. Hell, I could fit Oz in my shaving kit, but 
    come a full moon, he had a wolfy mojo not to be messed with. Powerful. All 
    of them. And I'm the guy who fixes the windows. 
  DAWN
    Well, you had that sexy army training for a while, and—and the windows 
    really did need fixing.
  XANDER
    I saw what you did last night.
  DAWN
    Yeah, I— (shakes her head embarrassed) I guess I kinda lost my head when 
    I thought I was the slayer.
  XANDER
    You thought you were all special. Miss Sunnydale 2003. And the minute you 
    found out you weren't, you handed the crown to Amanda without a moment's pause. 
    You gave her your power.
  DAWN
    (shrugs) The power wasn't mine.
  XANDER
    They'll never know how tough it is, Dawnie, to be the one who isn't chosen. 
    To live so near to the spotlight and never step in it. But I know. I see more 
    than anybody realizes because nobody's watching me. I saw you last night. 
    I see you working here today. You're not special. You're extraordinary. (stands, 
    kisses her forehead, stands to walk out of the room)
  DAWN
    (tears welling in her eyes, calls after him) Maybe that's your power.
  XANDER
    (pauses at the door) What?
  DAWN
    Seeing. Knowing.
  XANDER
    Maybe it is. Maybe I should get a cape. 
  DAWN
    Cape is good. 
  XANDER
    Yeah. (leaves the room) 
  Dawn gathers herself together, never letting a tear drop. She breathes 
    deeply, then goes back to work on the books at her desk.
