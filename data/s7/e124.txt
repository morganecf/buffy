Fade to black.

The Start Of Episode



PROLOGUE
20     EXT.      NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
  Loud techno music is playing. A bright blue neon sign is pointing to the club, 
  that reads "Tatoo Nachtlocal." Zoom down to street level, where a 
  sign points to "Parkplatz." We see a car driving toward the building. 
  
TITLE CARD: Frankfurt, Germany
Zoom back up to the third floor where we can see through the glass hallway. 
  Zoom inside.
21     INT.      PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT
  A girl is running and looks scared. She has hot pink hair with black bangs at 
  her forehead, a nose ring, and a metal collar. She's wearing all black, with 
  a skeleton shirt, long pants, a leather jacket and boots. She goes through an 
  interior door and jumps down to the next level. Two people are chasing her. 
  They look suspiciously like the robed men from episode 7x01 "Lessons". 
  We can't see any details of their bodies, just the hooded cloaks that completely 
  cover them. She runs out through an exterior door and proceeds to scale down 
  the building. Finally, she thinks she's safe when she goes through a doorway 
  to the outside near a crowd of club patrons, but she is pushed back inside by 
  her pursuers. They close the door behind them and start to fight with her. She 
  is knocked to the ground, lying on her back. Finally, one of the robed people 
  pulls out a curved silver dagger and tries to stab her, but she blocks his move. 
  The other robed person also has a dagger though and stabs her. She winces, and 
  the men resheath their daggers and leave. After the girl appears dead, she turns 
  her head to look directly in the camera and speaks in a low, unnatural sounding 
  voice.
GERMAN GIRL
  From beneath you, it devours.
Cut to:
  22     INT.      BUFFY'S 
    BEDROOM IN BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
  Buffy screams. 
BUFFY (O.S.) 
  Ah!
Dawn is sitting beside Buffy, leaning over her, trying to wake her up.
DAWN
  Buffy! Buffy! Buffy!
BUFFY
  I heard screaming.
DAWN
  That was you.
BUFFY
  There was a girl.
DAWN
  That would be me.
BUFFY
  Uh, no. It was...
DAWN
  Just a dream. It was just a dream, right? 
BUFFY
  From beneath you, it devours. That's what she said, and then they... There's 
  more like her, Dawn. Out there somewhere.
Buffy and Dawn get up off the bed and go to look out the window, frowning 
  sadly.
BUFFY
  And they're gonna die. 
Zoom out the window to the street.
Cut to:
  23     EXT.      NEIGHBORHOOD 
    STREET - NIGHT
  We see grass and hear rumbling noises coming from underground. The force is 
  progressing along a path, like it's caused by something specific that is moving 
  purposefully underground. Shrubs are shaking and a birdbath falls over. Then 
  the sidewalk is pushed up from underneath, cracking. A curvy line is cut down 
  the street.
Opening credits and title sequence.
ACT I.
24     INT.      BASEMENT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Water is dripping down the walls, like in a typical basement. Zoom to cute 
    rat sitting on boxes in foreground. The rat squeaks. Zoom to background, crouched 
    behind some boxes, Spike is stalking the rat, crawling slowly toward it between 
    the boxes.
SPIKE
  No, no, no, no, no, no. Now is not the time. You know it. I know it. But 
  making them understand... is a totally different matter. No manners is the problem. 
  Proper breeding. Lack of etiquette. All of it lacking. All of it lost on them. 

There's a rumbling sound, then the ground starts to shake. Spike stands 
  and looks around alarmed. 
SPIKE
  Not the time. Not hardly ready. 
He starts to wince.
SPIKE
  Stop. Please, mum! Begging now! Make it stop! Oh, God! 
Spike holds his hands over his ears trying to block out the sounds. He screams 
  in agony.
SPIKE
  Ooh! Aaahhhh!
Cut to:
25     INT.      XANDER'S CAR - DAY
  Dawn is in the backseat of Xander's four-door sedan. Xander's driving, and Buffy 
  is the passenger. Xander is driving Buffy and Dawn to school.
DAWN
  Could you die? 'Cause, seriously, speaking for everybody who are me in the car 
  right now, we're very excited.
BUFFY
  Well, I'm glad for all of you then.
DAWN
  I mean, it's just so cool. You're coming to school with me. You'll be, like, 
  there the whole time. (pauses) You understand you cannot talk to me, look at 
  me, or hang out with any of my friends, right?
BUFFY
  Look, I doubt we'll be seeing each other, assuming I even half-understand my 
  fuzzy job description.
DAWN
  It's not fuzzy. You're, what, dealing with troubled kids?
XANDER
  At a spanking new Hellmouth High. Please. Outside of drugs and violence and 
  the unwanted pregnancy, and, uh, unleashing of hordes of Armageddon that comes 
  pouring out of the school's foundation every now and then, what trouble could 
  these kids have?
BUFFY
  Guess I'll find out.
XANDER
  Those kids are damn lucky having a slayer and a friend on campus there for 'em. 
  I hope they appreciate it. I know I did. (pauses) Days gone by, huh?
DAWN
  I thought you hated Sunnydale.
XANDER
  Yes, and no, with an emphasis on the yes. But, at least then I was dating.
BUFFY
  You could be dating now.
XANDER
  Yeah. Um, I don't know what's not clicking for me right now.
BUFFY
  Well, there's that thing with Anya.
XANDER
  That leaving her at the altar thing?
BUFFY
  Yeah, that one. That's not something you bounce right back from.
XANDER
  Sure it is. She bounced back to being a vengeance demon, and I bounced back 
  to being a dateless nerd.
DAWN
  Do you guys talk at all?
XANDER
  I've seen her at the Bronze a couple of times. I guess there's a lot of scorned 
  women there, making vengeance wishes on their exes.
BUFFY
  (Southern accent) I know that's where I go to get my scorn on.
DAWN
  You guys need to really to ease up with the whole dating demons thing.
BUFFY
  Uh, hello, I'm sorry. Wasn't that you having the smooch-a-thon with teen vampire 
  last Halloween?
DAWN
  See, this is why I don't want you talking to my friends. (sighs) Oh. 
Cut to:
26     INT.      BUFFY'S OFFICE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - 
  DAY
  Principal Wood is showing her around on her first day at work. Buffy has a cubicle 
  near a hallway window. They enter the office area from the hallway.
PRINCIPAL
  We'll sort of feel our way around. Some students will be sent to you, and 
  others, I'm hoping, will start to come in on their own.
BUFFY
  What if they don't? Should I panic?
PRINCIPAL
  You'll be surprised, Buffy. You're the youngest, and, uh, least stuffy member 
  of this faculty. I think the students are gonna want to come in and talk to 
  you. And when they do, don't evaluate them. Just listen. They need to feel like 
  there's someone around here who actually understands them.
While Buffy looks out the window nearest her cubicle, she gets an exciting 
  idea.
BUFFY
  Can I give detention?
PRINCIPAL
  OK by me. A little authority can be a wonderful thing. Just remember that while 
  you are here to help, you're not here to be their friend. Trust me, you open 
  that door, and these students will eat you alive.
BUFFY
  You heard about Principal Flutie, right?
PRINCIPAL
  Hmm?
BUFFY
  Forget it.
Buffy sits down at her desk and starts to get situated.
PRINCIPAL
  OK then. And, Buffy, relax. There's only three things these kids understand: 
  the boot, the bat, and the bastinada. (chuckles) 
Buffy doesn't laugh, but instead gives him a blank stare.
PRINCIPAL
  It's the... it's a... it's a bad joke. It's the bastinada. No one ever knows 
  what that thing is.
BUFFY
  Wooden rod to slap the soles of the feet in Turkish prisons, but if made with 
  the correct wood makes an awesome Billy club.
PRINCIPAL
  I think you're gonna fit in just fine. Is there something else?
BUFFY
  Um, yeah. Uh, just one more thing. (stands) I was, uh, just curious, you know, 
  uh—not that I'm not grateful or anything. But, uh, I guess I was wondering 
  why I—
PRINCIPAL
  Have this job?
BUFFY
  I still haven't finished college.
PRINCIPAL
  I know.
BUFFY
  Was it my sparkling personality? Or maybe you enjoyed my work at the Doublemeat 
  Palace?
PRINCIPAL
  I'm a vegetarian. These students need someone around here who understands them, 
  and I need someone who understands these students. Why? Is there something about 
  you that I don't know that maybe I should?
BUFFY
  Nothing I can think of.
PRINCIPAL
  Oh, if you'll excuse me. First catch of the day. I'll be in my office if you 
  need me.
BUFFY
  Thanks. I'm just gonna have a look around. Get to know the place. Make sure 
  it's all... school-like.
Cut to:
27     INT.      HALLWAY SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
  Shot of the basement access door with a sign that says "Basement / No Student 
  Access."
Cut to: 
28     INT.      BASEMENT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
  Buffy is walking around in the dark empty basement looking for someone. She 
  calls out to see if he is there.
BUFFY
  Spike? 
She hears rats squeaking. There's a noise. A metal door shuts. She calls 
  out again to see who was there.
BUFFY
  Spike?
Still no answer. 
Cut to: 
29     INT.      MANOR IN ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
  Willow is sitting on a suitcase in an exterior doorway, talking to Giles who 
  walks up the interior hallway toward her and leans with one arm on the doorjamb 
  over her head. They are both facing the same direction, looking out at the countryside.
TITLE CARD: Westbury, England
GILES
  The taxi's here.
WILLOW
  I know.
GILES
  And in keeping with a quaint old Birtish tradition, you would now be expected 
  to get into it.
WILLOW
  I don't know if I can. Giles, I'm not done here.
Walks around to talk to her face-to-face, leans on the opposite doorjamb.
GILES
  That's your fear talking.
WILLOW
  Yes, and my fear's a big, obnoxious blabbermouth. You're the one that keeps 
  telling me to trust my instincts.
GILES
  True.
WILLOW
  So, shouldn't we be listening? I don't want to go back home just so I can screw 
  up again. I Why don't I stay? Not forever. Just long enough to, I don't know, 
  make my fear shut up a little, maybe?
Taxi honks. Giles steps outside and waves to acknowledge it. He faces Willow 
  again.
GILES
  It's possible, but... Try to be very specific. What exactly are you afraid of?
WILLOW
  Well, for starters, how 'bout the hellmouth's getting all rumbly again. And 
  now I know it's got teeth. And are those literal teeth, 'cause I don't know 
  if I can handle it. And what if I can handle it? Does that mean I have to be 
  a bigger, badder badass than the source of all badness? And what if I give up 
  all this control stuff and I go all veiny and homicidal again? And what if—
GILES
  They won't take you back?
WILLOW
  Uh-huh. 
GILES
  Willow, we could spend another two years here training and practicing and learning 
  to hone your powers and still there'd be no way of knowing for sure that the 
  friends you left behind you are still your friends.
WILLOW
  Well, sure. I mean, if you put it that way, duh. 
GILES
  I'd love to offer you some guarantee that you'd be welcomed back to Sunnydale 
  with open arms, but I can't. You may not be wanted, but you will be needed.
WILLOW
  That all you got?
GILES
  For the moment, yes. 
WILLOW
  OK. I guess I'd better...
Willow stands. Giles picks up her suitcase and opens an umbrella. 
GILES
  Trust yourself, and the others might follow.
They walk out to the taxi.
Cut to:
  30     EXT.      NEIGHBORHOOD 
    STREET - NIGHT
    Zoomed in on a Yorkie puppy on a string. It is being walked by its owner, 
    who's holding its leash and a plastic grocery bag. The dog stops walking to 
    smell something on the concrete sidewalk. There's some random rocks and gravel 
    strewn on that part of the sidewalk. The dog growls and makes sounds of displeasure 
    at whatever it smells.
NANCY
  Rocky, come on, do your business so I can go home. 
Rocky growls.
NANCY
  Could've gotten a cat, but no.
  Rocky growls, then winces and yelps. Nancy turns to look, but a hole has 
    suddenly appeared and Rocky has disappeared into it. She is still holding 
    onto his leash, and as a result she falls to the ground and is pulled along 
    the sidewalk toward the hole as the leash is pulled further into it. When 
    her head is almost to the tiny hole where the dog disappeared, a large piece 
    of the sidewalk comes up in her face, broken and pushed up from underground 
    by something unseen. Then a monster rises from the ground in front of her. 
    She gets up and runs away as fast as she can, screaming, but bumps into Xander 
    who is out for an evening stroll.
NANCY
  Ahh!
XANDER
  Uh, hello?
Cut to:
31     INT.      LIVING ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Sitting between Xander and Dawn, Nancy is sitting on the sofa talking to Buffy.
NANCY
  And whatever it was, it was big and strong. Stronger than.... I mean, I don't 
  know how it's possible. You hear thing in this town, living here in Sunnydale, 
  but nobody actually believes them. You know, you'd have to be crazy, and... 
  You guys think that I'm crazy, don't you?
XANDER
  (scoffs) I don't.
BUFFY
  We've seen things, too, Nancy.
XANDER
  (macho) And we're going to take care of this. It's your lucky night... considering, 
  you know, your dog just got all ate up and stuff... (caught himself) Hey, can 
  I freshen up your tea?
NANCY
  No, that's OK. Thanks.
Xander is trying to impress this girl, but is frustrated at how stupid he's 
  acting around her. He shakes his head in disgust.
DAWN
  So, you say this thing just came up out of the ground without any warnings or 
  signs or anything?
NANCY
  Just this kind of rumbling, you know, like just before an earthquake.
BUFFY
  From beneath you, it devours.
NANCY
  What?
BUFFY
  Nothing.
DAWN
  Nothing good.
XANDER
  Sounding monster-ific, all right.
DAWN
  Should we round up the gang?
XANDER
  Good thinking, except... this is the gang.
BUFFY
  Look, Nancy, we're going to get into this. And I promise you, if your dog is 
  alive, we're going to find him. The only thing that I need is a little—
From the foyer, just outside the living room, a voice interrupts her.
SPIKE
  What you need is help. Fortunately, you've got me.
Buffy looks shocked to see Spike here in her house, in front of her friends. 
  Standing next to the French doors, he is looking quite stylish, with his combed 
  bleached hair slicked straight back again, and wearing new clothes. He's seeming 
  quite confident and lucid, quite the opposite of how we last saw him in the 
  basement.
Fade to black.
ACT II.
32     INT.      LIVING ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
  Resume. Buffy is staring, slack-jawed, at Spike. He nods "hello" to 
  her.
SPIKE
  Buffy.
BUFFY
  Spike. 
Buffy gets up, walks across the room away from Spike, and looks out the 
  window. She's trying to gain her composure.
NANCY
  Who is that?
DAWN
  He's... it's Buffy's...
XANDER
  Ex.
NANCY
  And I'm thinking it's a little more complicated than just that.
XANDER
  Always is.
Buffy has gotten herself together and turns around to face Spike. Her voice 
  is cool and emotionless. 
BUFFY
  You've changed.
SPIKE
  I have.
BUFFY
  New clothing. Better hair. Not so much with the crazy. I like it. Now what do 
  you want?
SPIKE
  Easy. If you think I like putting myself here, surrounded by people who don't 
  particularly like me, you'd be wrong.
Xander stands up and speaks aggressively at Spike.
XANDER
  If you're uncomfortable, we can make you leave.
SPIKE
  I'll be quick. (to Buffy) We need to talk. Want to do that here, or privately?
XANDER
  I'm thinking here, in the company of good friends and pointy weapons.
Nancy seems taken aback by all the tension in the room.
BUFFY
  You said something about quick?
SPIKE
  I did. Before I start, and for the record, the last you saw me, I was a mess—out 
  of my head, admitted. Last week, living in the school basement, well, you saw 
  me.
Dawn looks disapprovingly from Spike to Buffy, and walks toward her. Xander 
  is also looking shocked.
DAWN
  You did?
BUFFY
  Guys, just a second, OK. Yes, I saw Spike. I just didn't—
DAWN
  What? You just forgot to mention it?
BUFFY
  Things were insane in the basement. I saved your life. We can discuss this later.
DAWN
  Sure.
XANDER
  (tenderly) Whatever you want.
DAWN
  Right. 'Cause that seems to be the only time you let us in, Buffy. Whenever 
  you want.
SPIKE
  Now, in fairness to Buffy—
XANDER
  (shouting) Shut up, Spike!
Nancy again looks uncomfortable at being there for this scene.
BUFFY
  (sighs). OK, guys. Give us a second.
Spike turns toward the foyer again, and Buffy follows. 
Cut to:
33     INT.      FOYER AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
  They talk near the front door. 
BUFFY
  Do not start by saying you're sorry.
SPIKE
  I didn't come here to atone.
BUFFY
  Then what the hell do you want?
SPIKE
  I'm here to help you.
BUFFY
  Help me what?
SPIKE
  I was hoping you'd tell me. You're the slayer. (Buffy crosses her arms over 
  her chest.) Connected to the visions. Long line of worthies, right? I'm just 
  a guy with his ear to the ground, and even I can feel it. Something's coming. 
  I don't know what exactly, but something's brewing. And it's so big, ugly and 
  damned it makes you and me look like little bitty puzzle pieces. I mean, if 
  I'm wrong, say so. Lovely. No hard feelings. I'll go out that door and you can 
  lock it behind me with any spell you like. So, am I wrong?
BUFFY
  Everything about you is wrong, Spike.
Spike takes this as his cue to leave and begins toward the door. He stops 
  when Buffy continues.
BUFFY
  But something is coming. 
SPIKE
  You're gonna need some help.
BUFFY
  Since when did you become the champion of the people?
SPIKE
  I didn't. I'm just a guy who can lend a hand, if you'll let me. Ball's in your 
  court, slayer.
Cut to:
34     INT.      LIVING ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
  Everyone who was there before is still in the living room, except now they're 
  standing. Buffy comes into the room, giving orders and ready to go. She's putting 
  on her jacket.
BUFFY
  OK, we're gonna split. Two pairs. Whatever this creature is, it's burrowing 
  through solid ground. That means a strength and power that we don't usually 
  deal with, but we may have to get used to now that the hellmouth is getting 
  all perky.
Buffy opens the weapons chest.
NANCY
  (whispering to Xander) Shouldn't we call the police, or something?
XANDER
  And tell them...?
NANCY
  I'll stop interrupting.
BUFFY
  Xander, take Nancy home. Drive, don't walk, and try not to stop 'til you get 
  there.
NANCY
  (to Xander) Is your girlfriend always this... commanding?
XANDER
  Who? Buffy? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. See, uh, I mean, she's a girl, and she's 
  a friend, but she's not my girlfriend.
DAWN
  Xander... 
Xander turns to face Dawn. She gestures casually, brushing a finger on the 
  side of her mouth.
DAWN
  ...a little drool.
He turns back to face Nancy and smiles a nervous laugh. Buffy is holding 
  a large dagger and a flashlight.
BUFFY
  Spike and I will check out the scene.
XANDER
  OK, in the biggest way, I am not loving this plan. (to Buffy) I am not loving 
  Spike. (whispering) He tried to rape you.
BUFFY
  And he failed. I know I can take him. Xander, take Nancy home. Spike and I will 
  patrol.
DAWN
  I'm command central, so everybody check in with me. OK, I'll be here doing my 
  homework, but the other one sounded cooler. 
BUFFY
  (to Dawn) Be safe. (to Spike) Let's go.
SPIKE
  Righty-o, then.
Buffy leaves the room. Spike starts to follow, and passes Dawn, who speaks 
  to him with a serious cold glare.
DAWN
  Spike. You sleep, right? You. Vampires. You sleep.
SPIKE
  Yeah. What's your point, niblet?
DAWN
  Well, I can't take you in a fight or anything, even with a chip in your head. 
  But you do sleep. If you hurt my sister at all... touch her... you're gonna 
  wake up on fire.
Cut to:
35     EXT.      NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT
    Buffy and Spike are patrolling, looking for the location where Nancy's dog 
    was abducted. They are talking without a lot of eye contact.
SPIKE
  You're awfully quiet.
BUFFY
  Wouldn't know what to say.
SPIKE
  Fine with me. I was more half-expecting to get an earful anyway. And when exactly 
  did your sister get unbelievably scary?
Buffy stops walking.
BUFFY
  What are you doing?
Spike turns to look her in the eye.
SPIKE
  What? I told you once, straight up, I'm here to help, and that's all. 
Spike changes the subject and turns to look away from her at the broken 
  sidewalk.
SPIKE
  Think this here is our spot?
BUFFY
  How'd you guess?
SPIKE
  I don't fancy sticking my head in there.
BUFFY
  Well, if something bites it off, that'd be a clue.
Spike looks at her and concedes to investigate the broken sidewalk further. 
  He bends down on one knee with the flashlight in hand to look inside the hole.
BUFFY
  So, what happened to you?
Spike's still all business, talking while looking around for clues.
SPIKE
  When you saw me. Those ghostly types in the school basement got in my head. 
  Made me flat-out, bug-shaggin' crazy. And I'm not exactly braggin' about it, 
  but they were stronger than I was. Made me see things, do things. 
He stops investigating, and looks her in the eyes. 
SPIKE
  And how come you never told anyone that you saw me?
BUFFY
  I don't know. I guess I was partly hoping you were some kind of mirage.
SPIKE
  Sorry to disappoint.
BUFFY
  Not your fault.
SPIKE
  Hold the torch, would you?
He's holding the flashlight toward her, but his hand and fingers are covering 
  the shaft of the light in such a way that she can't take it from him without 
  touching him. She takes it from him, and when they touch, she has agonizing 
  flashbacks of screaming and struggling during the attempted rape attack he made 
  on her back in episode 6x19 "Seeing Red". Buffy is revolted; Spike 
  is concerned.
BUFFY
  Look, this... us working together—it's not a way for us to get back together, 
  if that's what you want.
SPIKE
  It's not. Look, I can't blame you for being all skittish.
BUFFY
  Skittish? That's not a word I would use for it. You tried to rape me. I don't 
  have the words.
SPIKE
  Neither do I. I can't say sorry. Can't use forgive me. All I can say is: Buffy, 
  I've changed.
BUFFY
  I believe you.
SPIKE
  Well, that's something.
BUFFY
  I just don't know what you've changed into. You come back to town. You make 
  with the big surprises. Twice. I don't know what your game is, Spike, but I 
  know there's something you're not telling me.
SPIKE
  You're right. There is. (stands) But we're not best friends anymore, so too 
  bad for me. I'm not sharing. We've been through things. The end of the world 
  and back. I can be useful 'cause, honestly, I've got nothing better to do. Make 
  use of me if you want. (gesturing to the sidewalk)And there's nothing here. 
  Just a bit of slime. Mounds of displaced dirt and such. Whatever our beastie 
  is, he's gone. 
Spike walks off alone, back down the street in the direction from which 
  they came.
Cut to:
36     INT.      NANCY'S BUILDING - NIGHT
  Xander is walking Nancy to the front door of her building. She unlocks it, and 
  they enter.
NANCY
  Boy, I still can't believe this is happening. I mean even with this town's 
  reputation for, you know, unexplained weirdness.
XANDER
  (chuckles) Right. Sunnydale: come for the food, stay for the dismemberment.
NANCY
  There's good food? Well... Thanks. (clears throat) And that's a couple of levels 
  of lameness right there, me saying "thanks" after everything you've 
  done for me tonight.
XANDER
  Well, you could slip me a twenty, but then I'd have to act all offended.
NANCY
  Got it. So, um, you think I might instead give you a call sometime?
XANDER
  Just to check in?
NANCY
  No, actually, I'm hitting on you.
XANDER
  Even better. I'm very listed.
NANCY
  And I'm really pushy, so that works out well, then. Good night.
XANDER
  Uh, Nancy...
The ground is rumbling and shaking.
XANDER
  I just got a swell idea... run!
  The glass in the front door shatters in toward them. Nancy screams. They 
    run further into the building down the hallway. Floor tiles are shattering 
    and bursting up from the ground behind them as they flee. Finally, they go 
    up some stairs at the end of the hallway and fall to the ground. The monster 
    bursts forth from the floor in front of the stairs. It's a long, pink, cylindrical, 
    and slightly phallic-shaped creature with four jaws full of sharp, pointy 
    teeth. It's roaring and screeching and its jaws are snapping as it lunges 
    for Xander and Nancy. They wait it out together, and finally, it retreats 
    into the ground.
XANDER
  You OK?
NANCY
  I just...
XANDER
  Dumb question. Are you injured? Are you hurt?
NANCY
  I don't think so. I just—I don't think I can take any more of this.
XANDER
  Two attacks in the same night. I'm starting to think it's not coincidence.
NANCY
  Oh, sure. Why not? A monster trying to kill me. It's just the thing that was 
  missing to make my life absolutely perfect. Uhh! Ronnie would love this. Boy!
XANDER
  Right. Who's Ronnie?
NANCY
  Oh, um, only my psycho ex-boyfriend that I've been trying to get rid of for 
  the past few weeks. I almost prefer the monster. Ronnie was, um... trouble.
XANDER
  Uh-huh. And I'm just curious. Was this Ronnie guy a borrowing money kind of 
  trouble or was he a raising demon trouble kind of guy?
NANCY
  Ronnie? He couldn't. He just... "he was an abusive bastard" is the 
  catchy headline. And he'd just show up, even after... you know the feeling that 
  you get when your ex is constantly ruining every part of your life, and it just 
  doesn't stop?
XANDER
  Yes.
NANCY
  And you get so tired of feeling helpless that all you can do is just wish that 
  it would stop?
XANDER
  Wish?
Cut to:
37     INT.      BRONZE NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT
  Anya, stirring her mixed drink, is sharing a table with a young woman she met 
  at the club.
YOUNG WOMAN
  And it's not the fact that he cheated, it's the way he cheated, you know? 
  I mean, we could have talked. I could have handled it.
ANYA
  Uh-huh. Uh-huh, I get it. Go on.
YOUNG WOMAN
  You know what he is? He's spineless. Yeah, that's it. He's—he's like this spineless 
  little pig. And you know what I wish?
ANYA
  God, do I want to.
Fade to black.
ACT III.
  38     INT.      BRONZE NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT
    Resume.
  ANYA
    You were saying...
  YOUNG WOMAN
  Um, I want more quesadillas.
  ANYA
  Before that.
  YOUNG WOMAN
  A margarita.
  ANYA
  After that.
  YOUNG WOMAN
  Oh, yeah. God, my boyfriend's spineless, and he should just—you know, he should 
  just be spineless for real.
  ANYA
  No spine. Got it. I can do that.
  YOUNG WOMAN
  What do you mean?
  ANYA
  See, honey, what I'm driving us towards here is sometimes, don't you just wish 
  that— Oh, penis!
  Sees that Xander has walked in with Nancy, Buffy, and Spike in tow.
  XANDER
  (to Nancy) Is this the one you talked to?
  Nancy nods.
  ANYA
  (to young woman) I tell you what—why don't we put a pin in it? Why don't you 
  get yourself a drink, and we'll pick it up in a few, OK?
  Buffy, Spike, Xander and Nancy crowd around Anya's table while the other 
    girl leaves.
  ANYA
  You guys, I am working here.
  BUFFY
  We noticed.
  SPIKE
  That's why we're here.
  XANDER
  Riiiight. Did you turn this nice lady's ex into a giant worm-monster?
  ANYA
  (laughs) Yes.
  NANCY
  No way. Are you saying that thing was Ronnie?
  ANYA
  You wish it, I dish it. I thought we were clear on this. I didn't think you 
  were going to go all narc on me.
  BUFFY
  You wished your ex was a worm?
  NANCY
  Well, we were just talking.
  XANDER
  Anya has a way of making things happen.
  ANYA
  I had a quota; the guy had it coming. What's the big?
  NANCY
  I think I'm gonna be sick.
  BUFFY
  Anya, that thing you created burst through solid pavement and ate her dog.
  ANYA
  (squeaks) Ooh, puppy!
  XANDER
  Wait, that gets your sad noise? People's lives are in danger, and you give it 
  up for the Yorkie?
  ANYA
  You never understood me, Xander.
  NANCY
  Xander, who is this woman?
  XANDER
  Anya, she's, um, Anya. My ex.
  NANCY
  Oh.
  ANYA
  Hey, nobody's bragging here.
  Anya gets up from the table and starts to walk off. Spike steps up to her 
    to stop her from leaving by grabbing her upper arms.
  SPIKE
  Ah, ah, ah...
  ANYA
  Hey, hands off the merchandise. Spike, you don't get to go there again.
  SPIKE
  Please. I've already forgotten about our little time together.
  NANCY
  I thought you were Xander's ex-girlfriend.
  ANYA
  I am. 
  NANCY
  But you and Spike...
  ANYA
  Had a thing. 
  SPIKE
  Didn't last.
  NANCY
  But weren't you Buffy—
  SPIKE
  Briefly.
  BUFFY
  Never serious.
  NANCY
  Is there anyone here that hasn't slept together?
  Xander and Spike exchange a glance and then look away from each other too 
    quickly. Spike rolls his eyes.
  ANYA
  Look, at least we're all bipeds, which is more than I can say for Ronnie, the 
  worm boy.
  BUFFY
  OK, guys, can we focus here for just a second? Anya, this is Ronnie. OK? He 
  wasn't a worm. (gestures three inches with her thumb and forefinger) Worms are 
  like this big. (gesturing with her hands apart) This thing was like —
  SPIKE
  Sluggoth demon. Am I right?
  ANYA
  (sighs, rolls eyes) Maybe.
  NANCY
  Wait, I didn't wish for that. I mean, I don't even know what this whatchamacallit 
  demon thing is.
  SPIKE
  Sluggoth demon. It's a very large, very nasty, natural predator who died around 
  the crusades.
  ANYA
  Same phylum. It's not cheating, I just embellished.
  XANDER
  Well, you can un-embellish now.
  ANYA
  Bite me, Harris. I have rules to work with. Vengeance demon codes of conduct. 
  But you'll never understand 'cause you're all still so... human.
  Spike steps up to Anya and gets in her face.
  SPIKE
  I'm not. Demon, just like yourself, Anya. Now, you're gonna turn the spell around 
  like a good little vengeance demon or I—- what?
  Anya stares into Spike's eyes with a look of astonishment. 
  ANYA
  Oh, my God!
  SPIKE
  What are you staring at?
  ANYA
  Oh, my God!
  SPIKE
  Right. Let's go.
  Spike tries to walk away, but Anya grabs hold of his forearm.
  ANYA
  How did you do it?
  BUFFY
  Spike, what is she talking about?
  ANYA
  I can see you.
  SPIKE
  Nothing. Let's go. Got some worm hunting to do.
  Spike tries again to leave, but Anya is being insistent.
  ANYA
  How did you do it?
  SPIKE
  Shut up. 
  ANYA
  You shouldn't be allowed to. 
  SPIKE
  Shut your mouth!
  ANYA
  I mean, how did you get it?
  SPIKE
  I said you shut up!
  Spike punches Anya in the face with his free arm. She falls to the floor. 
    Nancy leaves. Anya kicks Spike across the room. He lands on the pool table. 
    When she gets back up again, she is in demon face. Spike is not.
  ANYA
  I am so gonna kick your ass.
  Spike gets up off the pool table, fully ready to engage Anya in a fight.
  SPIKE
  Right, bitch. Round and round we—
  But Buffy cuts him off by grabbing his arm and turning him to face her. 
    He is in demon face now.
  BUFFY
  You haven't changed, Spike.
  Buffy punches him in the face. He punches back. They continue to fight. 
    Buffy is angry, and Spike is being an ass, goading her. He's not fighting 
    back anymore.
  SPIKE
  Working out some personal issues, are we? (Buffy punches and kicks him). Hey, 
  I guess this would be first contact since, uh, you know when. Ooh, up for another 
  round up on the balcony, then? (She hits him again, and he lands on the floor; 
  he laughs) Right you are, luv. I haven't changed. Not a lick. (He's in her face 
  now.) And watching your face trying to figure me out was absolutely delicious.
  XANDER
  Buffy!
  BUFFY
  Not now, Xander.
  XANDER
  Nancy. She's gone. And out there all alone, she's worm bait. 
  BUFFY
  I'll go find her. Stay with Anya. Get her to reverse that spell.
  SPIKE
  Hey, is that it? A little touchy-feely, and then you're off to the bat poles?
  Buffy leaves the Bronze. 
  Cut to:
  39     EXT.      CITY STREET - NIGHT
    Nancy is walking home from the Bronze alone on a deserted street. 
  NANCY
    Freaks. Why do I always surround myself with freaks?
  She hears a rumbling from behind her. The worm demon has found her and is 
    closing in. The street behind her is rupturing from underneath, the asphalt 
    is crumbling. It's getting closer now. 
  NANCY
  Oh, God. Oh, God.
  She tries to get into a building, but it's locked. 
  NANCY
  Help! Somebody help me!
  She climbs the fire escape ladder, she looks down, and the rumbling stops. 
    She's relieved and tries to catch her breath. Then the building starts to 
    shake, and the ladder starts to fall off the brick building it's attached 
    to. Nancy screams. 
  NANCY
  Oh, help me! Help me!
  Buffy sees her from the rooftop and runs to her. Spike is also running 
    along the rooftops behind Buffy.
  Cut to:
  40     INT.      BRONZE NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT
    Xander is talking to Anya.
  ANYA
    What do you want me to do?
  XANDER
  Reverse the spell.
  ANYA
  It's not that easy, Xander.
  XANDER
  You can do it.
  ANYA
    Yeah, sure, the spell part. What about me? I'm in enough trouble as it is. 
    Halfrek's all over my case. D'Hoffrin is not pleased with my work. You don't 
    want to see him angry. Trust me.
  XANDER
  Nice friends you got.
  ANYA
  Nice friends I had. Chums. Coworkers. Bridesmaids. Oh, I had the whole package 
  until something fell apart. What could that be, Xander?
  XANDER
  You saying this was my fault?
  ANYA
  All I'm saying is none of this happened until you dumped me at the altar.
  XANDER
  And sooner or later, Anya, that excuse just stops working.
  Cut to:
  41     EXT.      CITY STREET - NIGHT
    Nancy is still trying to climb the ladder. The worm demon makes another bang 
    against the building's foundation, and Nancy falls off. Buffy swings in from 
    the rooftops on a rope, catches Nancy, and lets go when they are over a cushioned 
    place to land (flattened cardboard boxes). They are on the ground now. They 
    walk around to assess the situation, but the worm demon comes up out of the 
    ground next to Buffy. She's about to attack it when Spike lands behind her 
    and rips a pipe off the wall.
  SPIKE
    You've had your turn, luv. Leave the real violence to the demons, yeah?
  He rears back with the pipe in hand and beats the worm demon with it. 
  
  SPIKE
  That's right. Big bad's back, and looking for a little death!
  Then he steps back dramatically, holding the pipe like a deadly spear 
    and plunges it into the worm demon right as it turns back into the naked, 
    vulnerable human, Ronnie. Ronnie and Spike scream. Spike clutches his head, 
    and then has a look of horror on his face realizing what he has inadvertently 
    done.
  Fade to black.
ACT IV.
  42     EXT.      CITY STREET - NIGHT
    Resume. 
  RONNIE
  Ow!
  SPIKE
  (sincerely) I'm sorry.
  Spike cocks his head and removes the spear from Ronnie. Buffy runs to Ronnie's 
    aid with a blanket. Spike holds the spear with both hands and looks at it, 
    talking to himself.
  SPIKE
  Right. Wrong. All wrong. Wrong maneuver. Not hardly helpful.
  Nancy walks over to Ronnie.
  SPIKE
  God, please help me. (screaming, to Buffy) Help me!
  BUFFY
  You're not the one who needs help. He's going into shock. 
  Buffy dials 9-1-1 while Spike mumbles under his breath.
  SPIKE
  No. No. Too much. Too much. Too much. Too much. Too much. Too much. Too much. 
  (more inaudible rambling) ...inside me all the way.
  BUFFY
  (into phone) Yeah, I need an ambulance. Someone's been stabbed. (pause) Oh, 
  God, uh, corner of Third and Fairview. (to Ronnie) OK, help is coming. Try not 
  to move.
  Spike taps his chest.
  SPIKE
  Deep, deep, deep inside me.
  BUFFY
  Look, Spike, whatever you're doing—
  SPIKE
    (addressing someone who's not there) Get away. Get. Uhh—
  BUFFY
  Do it somewhere else. I am through with this.
  SPIKE
  Oh, oh, lucky girl. Call it quits. Now, there's an option. If only it were so 
  easy. If only— If only— If only— (addressing someone who's not there) What 
  the hell are you screaming about? I can hear you. No need to (screams) SHOUT!
  While saying shout, Spike's voice and face change into a scream of agony; 
    he's bends over in pain. He stands up and laughs, still holding the pipe.
  SPIKE
  I get it. The joke's on me. Lots of laughs. (twirling the pipe slowly, like 
  a baton) Yeah. Hey, bring the wife and kiddies. Come see the show 'cause it's 
  going to be a circus. This... (walks toward Buffy and kneels in front of her) 
  just the beginning, luv. A warm-up act. The real headliner's coming, and when 
  that band hits the stage, all of this... (stands up and gestures to the buildings 
  around them) all this... will come tumbling in death and screaming, horror and 
  bloodshed. (points to Ronnie) From beneath you, it devours. From beneath... 
  (starts to cry, and looks away) Poor Rocky. 
  Spike is all choked up. At first, he's crying but then starts to gag. He 
    runs away down the alley, leaving Buffy there with Ronnie and Nancy. Xander 
    comes running to them, and Anya is following, sauntering slowly.
  XANDER
  Buffy!
  NANCY
  You. You did this. What are you?
  Nancy sighs and walks away. Buffy takes off her jacket and folds it up into 
    a pillow that she puts under Ronnie's head.
  XANDER
  She's not calling me. 
  Buffy stands and hands Xander her cell phone. 
  BUFFY
  OK. Help is on the way. Look after him.
  Buffy runs off down the alley after Spike.
  XANDER
  Where you goin'?
  Anya, frowning, steps toward Ronnie. 
  XANDER
  You did the right thing here.
  ANYA
  Tell him that. 
  XANDER
  You reversed the spell. It took guts. I know this is bad, but it could be worse.
  ANYA
  Oh, it will be. 
  Cut to:
  43     EXT.      CEMETERY - NIGHT
    Buffy is walking through a moonlit cemetery alone, looking around for Spike. 
    She sees the chapel, with lanterns lighting the front door. She heads toward 
    it.
  Cut to:
  44     INT.      CHAPEL AT CEMETERY - NIGHT
    An oval painting on the wall is lit with moonlight streaming into the small 
    chapel. It appears to be a medieval painting of Mary holding baby Jesus and 
    standing in front of a fringed white drape. Zoom down to Buffy walking through 
    the front door. The chapel is set up with a dozen wooden pews arranged on 
    either side of a central aisle. There is a large, simple, gothic crucifix 
    at the front of the chapel that can be seen by looking directly down the central 
    aisle. Buffy looks around. There are three stained glass arched windows on 
    each sidewall of the chapel. She walks forward and jumps when Spike speaks 
    to her from the shadows behind her.
  SPIKE
  Hello.
  BUFFY
  What the hell are you—?
  Spike is bare-chested, holding his shirt out to her.
  SPIKE
  It didn't work. Costume. Didn't help. Couldn't hide.
  BUFFY
  No more mind games, Spike.
  Spike is looking down at the ground even though he is standing right in 
    front of her.
  SPIKE
  No more mind games. No more mind. 
  Buffy reaches for his chest, where the scars seen in episode 7x01 "Lessons" 
    are healing.
  BUFFY
  Tell me what happened to you.
  Spike flinches, recoils violently, and looks her into her eyes.
  SPIKE
  Hey, hey, hey! No touching. Am I flesh? Am I flesh to you? Feed on flesh. My 
  flesh. Nothing else. Not a spark. (nods) Oh, fine. Flesh then. Solid through. 
  (starts unzipping his pants) Get it hard; service the girl. 
  Buffy is disgusted and smacks his hands away from his pants.
  BUFFY
  Stop it!
  Spike reflexively reaches up and grabs her by the throat. Buffy grabs his 
    shoulder and throws him across the room. Spike lands on top of some pews, 
    breaking them into pieces. He sits up a little, propped on his elbows behind 
    him.
  SPIKE
  Right. Girl doesn't want to be serviced. Because there's no spark. Ain't we 
  in a soddin' engine?
  Spike's looking around the room. Buffy walks over to him.
  BUFFY
  Spike, have you completely lost your mind?
  SPIKE
  (lucidly) Well, yes. Where've you been all night?
  BUFFY
  You thought you would just come back here and... be with me?
  SPIKE
  First time for everything.
  BUFFY
  This is all you get. I'm listening. Tell me what happened.
  SPIKE
  I tried to find it, of course.
  BUFFY
  Find what?
  SPIKE
  The spark. The missing... the piece that fit. That would make me fit. Because 
  you didn't want... (starts to cry) God, I can't... Not with you looking. 
  Spike stands and walks away to a nearby window. He stands there, mostly 
    in shadow, his body directed away from her. He looks back over his shoulder 
    at her.
  SPIKE
  I dreamed of killing you.
  Keeping an eye on him, Buffy bends down to pick up a large splinter from 
    the broken pews at her feet to use as a stake, if necessary. Spike starts 
    pacing.
  SPIKE
  I think they were dreams. So weak. Did you make me weak, thinking of you, holding 
  myself, and spilling useless buckets of salt over your... ending? Angel—he 
  should've warned me. He makes a good show of forgetting, but it's here, in me, 
  all the time. (walks around toward her from behind) The spark. I wanted to give 
  you what you deserve, and I got it. They put the spark in me and now all it 
  does is burn. 
  Buffy's face shows shock, disbelief and, finally, comprehension.
  BUFFY
  Your soul.
  SPIKE
  (laughs) Bit worse for lack of use.
  Buffy turns to face him.
  BUFFY
  You got your soul back. How?
  SPIKE
  It's what you wanted, right? (looking at the ceiling) It's what you wanted, 
  right? (presses his fingers to his temples, looks down, and walks toward the 
  altar). And—and now everybody's in here, talking. Everything I did...everyone 
  I— and him... and it... the other, the thing beneath—beneath you. It's here 
  too. Everybody. They all just tell me go... go... (looks back over his shoulder 
  to Buffy) to hell.
  BUFFY
  Why? Why would you do that—
  SPIKE
  Buffy, shame on you. Why does a man do what he mustn't? For her. To be hers. 
  To be the kind of man who would nev— (looks away) to be a kind of man. 
  Spike walks toward the 6-foot-tall crucifix altarpiece at the front of the 
    chapel. Sounds like he's quoting something.
  SPIKE
  She shall look on him with forgiveness, and everybody will forgive and love. 
  He will be loved. 
  Spike's standing only a foot away from the crucifix, staring at it.
  SPIKE
  So everything's OK, right? (sighs) 
  Spike embraces the crucifix, resting one arm over each side of the cross 
    bar, and resting his head in the corner of the vertex. His body is sizzling 
    and smoke is rising from where it touches the cross.
  SPIKE
