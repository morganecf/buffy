  RECAP: (Skip Recap...)

  GILES (V.O.)
    Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
  1     INT.     CHAPEL 
    AT CEMETERY - NIGHT
    There is a large, simple, gothic crucifix at the front of the chapel that 
    can be seen by looking directly down the central aisle. Spike embraces the 
    crucifix, resting one arm over each side of the cross bar, and resting his 
    head in the corner of the vertex. His body is sizzling and smoke is rising 
    from where it touches the cross. A close-up of Buffy's face shows that she 
    is crying now. From where she stands, Spike's exhausted body hanging limply 
    on the cross resembles Jesus (except the view is of Spike's back).

  2     INT.     STRANGER'S 
    HOUSE - NIGHT
    Buffy is sitting on the edge of the bed. Spike is in front of her.
  SPIKE
    (kneels in front of her; looks into her eyes) And there's only one thing I've 
    ever been sure of: you. 
  Spike sits on the bed beside Buffy and puts his arm around her. She curls 
    up on him, cuddling up to his chest as he puts his arm around her shoulder, 
    holding her head with his hand.

  SPIKE (V.O.)
    You're the one, Buffy.

    CAR - NIGHT
    Xander is driving, and Dawn is unconscious in the seat beside him. She breathes 
    and moves a little. 
  DAWN
    (looks around) Where are we going?

  Xander hands Dawn a letter. Dawn opens the letter and starts reading.
  BUFFY (V.O.)
    Dearest Dawn, don't be angry with Xander. This isn't the place for either 
    of you.—
  Without letting Xander see it, Dawn puts a stun gun up to Xander's neck 
    and presses the button, zapping Xander and knocking him out. 
  Cut to:
  6     INT.     PYRAMIDAL 
    TOMB - NIGHT

    Buffy walks down into the tomb. It's lit inside, although dimly, by torches, 
    giving it an orange hue. Buffy looks around cautiously. Buffy sees a very 
    old woman with long white hair standing before her.
  WOMAN
    (admires the scythe) A scythe. Forged in secrecy for one like you.
  BUFFY
    Does this mean I can win?
  The woman's head cocks slightly to the side, and a cracking noise can 
    be heard. The woman falls to the ground. Buffy looks up and sees Caleb standing 
    there. Caleb picks up the scythe.

  CALEB
    I was kind of hoping it'd go this way. (rears back with the scythe)
  MAN (O.S.)
    Hey! (punches Caleb, knocking him down)
  Buffy looks up to see that it's Angel standing there having knocked Caleb 
    down. Buffy swings the scythe at Caleb, slicing his stomach. He stumbles back, 
    laughs heartily, wags his finger at her, and falls to the floor.
  ANGEL

    At least you could tell me you're glad to see me. (walks toward Buffy)
  Buffy drops the scythe to the floor and walks up to Angel, pressing herself 
    against his body and kisses him deeply on the lips. 
  Pan over to show Spike is in the tomb as well, hiding behind the pillar, 
    watching them. Buffy/First is beside him, whispering in his ear.
  BUFFY/FIRST
    That bitch.

    The Start Of Episode
  
  PROLOGUE:
  7     INT.     PYRAMIDAL 
    TOMB - NIGHT

    Resume. Angel and Buffy are kissing inside the tomb as Spike looks on from 
    the shadows.
  ANGEL
    (pulls back from the kiss) Well, I guess that qualifies as "happy to 
    see me."
  BUFFY
    (looks into Angel's eyes, smiling) Angel, what are you doing— (shakes 
    her head) Don't even. I just want to bask. (looks into Angel's eyes, smiling, 
    for a few seconds, then snaps out of it) OK, I'm basked. What are you doing 
    here?

  ANGEL
    Not saving the damsel in distress, that's for sure.
  BUFFY
    Oh, you know me. (picks up scythe) Not much with the damseling.
  ANGEL
    Got your share of distress, though. (walks to the wall) 

  BUFFY
    You heard?
  ANGEL
    (picks up a file folder from a bench by the wall) I got coverage on the whole 
    thing. It's very gripping. It needs a third act.
  BUFFY
    (shakes her head at him) You have to leave L.A. 

  ANGEL
    It's the First, right? The First evil. The power that tried to convince me 
    to kill myself.
  BUFFY
    Yeah. It's gotten a little more ambitious since then. It's raising an army.
  ANGEL
    Yeah, well, it failed once, and I'm here to tell you—

  Caleb stands up behind Angel and knocks Angel down by hitting him with 
    a cat statue, sending him across the floor. Caleb walks up to Buffy, black 
    blood streaming from his eyes and nose.
  CALEB
    Are you ready to finish this, bitch?!
  Cut to:
  Opening Credits.
  ACT I:

  8     INT.     PYRAMIDAL 
    TOMB - NIGHT
    Resume. Caleb, who's still holding his cat statue, has just confronted Buffy 
    in the tomb after having knocked Angel out.
  Caleb swings the cat statue at Buffy, but she blocks with the scythe and 
    then falls to the ground. She swings at him with the scythe, but he blocks 
    with the cat statue. Caleb knocks Buffy to the ground, then throws the cat 
    statue at Buffy. Buffy stands, holding the scythe.
  BUFFY
    (breathing hard) OK...how many times do I have to kill you? Ballpark figure.

  CALEB
    You understand nothing.
  Buffy swings at Caleb, but he grabs the scythe, holding it still, and 
    punches Buffy in the face twice. He lifts Buffy in the air, pressing her back 
    against the low ceiling. Buffy struggles, and Caleb finally lets her fall 
    to the floor. He walks up to her slowly, then picks her up by her lapels.
  CALEB
    (through gritted teeth) You think you have power over me?
  Buffy breaks free of his grip and kicks him, knocking him down to the 
    floor.  

  CALEB
    Stupid girl. (stands) You'll never stop me. You don't have the ba—
  While Caleb gets to his feet, Buffy twirls the scythe and swings it up 
    between his legs. Caleb's eyes go wide.
  BUFFY
    Who does nowadays?
  Caleb looks down incredulously at the scythe lodged in his body between 
    his legs. Buffy swiftly pushes the scythe up through his body.

  ANGEL
    (lying on the floor, regains consciousness and stands, angrily) OK, now I'm 
    pissed. Where is he?
  BUFFY
    (looks to her right, then to her left, then at Angel) He had to split. (giggles 
    devilishly)
  BUFFY/FIRST
    (whispering to Spike, who's still watching Buffy from the shadows) Yeah, she 
    needs you real bad.

  Angel picks up the folder again and brings it to Buffy. 
  BUFFY
    I'll have the guys go through that. See if there's anything new. Reliable 
    source?
  ANGEL
    Not remotely.
  BUFFY

    Mm, any port in an apocalypse.
  ANGEL
    I, uh, brought something else as well.
  Angel takes an amulet out of his pocket and holds it up for Buffy to see. 
    It's a 2-inch diameter round crystal pendant in a silver starburst setting 
    hung from a coarse silver chain.
  BUFFY
    (shakes her head) I can already tell you, I have nothing that goes with that.

  ANGEL
    It's not for you.
  BUFFY
    Splainy?
  ANGEL
    I don't know everything. It's very powerful and probably very dangerous. It 
    has a purifying power, a cleansing power, possibly scrubbing bubbles. The 
    translation is, uh—anyway, it bestows strength to the right person who 
    wears it.

  BUFFY
    And the right person is?
  ANGEL
    Someone ensouled, but stronger than human. A champion. As in me. 
  BUFFY
    Or me.

  ANGEL
    No. I don't know nearly enough about this to risk you wearing it. Besides, 
    you got that real cool axe-thing going for you.
  Spike walks out the back without being noticed.
  BUFFY
    So you're gonna be with me in this.
  ANGEL

    Shoulder to shoulder. I'm yours.
  BUFFY
    No.
  ANGEL
    No, what?
  BUFFY

    No. You're not gonna be in this fight. (walks away)
  ANGEL
    (cuts her off) Why the hell not?
  BUFFY
    'Cause I can't risk you.
  ANGEL

    You need me in this.
  BUFFY
    No, I need you gone. 
  ANGEL
    Why?
  BUFFY

    If I lose, if this thing gets past Sunnydale, then it's days—maybe hours—before 
    the rest of the world goes. I need a second front, and I need you to run it.
  ANGEL
    OK... (crosses his arms) that's one reason. What's the other?
  BUFFY
    (walks out of the tomb) There is no other.

  Cut to:
  9     EXT.     PYRAMIDAL 
    TOMB - NIGHT
    Buffy walks out of the tomb. Angel follows her.
  ANGEL
    Is it Spike? (Buffy stops walking, turns to face Angel) You're not telling 
    me something. And his scent, I remember it pretty well.

  BUFFY
    You vampires. Did anybody ever tell you the whole smelling people thing's 
    a little gross? (walks away)
  ANGEL
    (follows) Is he your boyfriend?
  BUFFY
    Is that your business?

  ANGEL
    You in love with him? OK, maybe I'm outta line, but this is kind of a curve 
    ball for me. I mean, we are talking about Spike here.
  BUFFY
    It's different. He's different. He has a soul now.
  ANGEL
    (stops) Oh. (looks up) Well.

  BUFFY
    What?
  ANGEL
    That's great. (mumbling to himself) Everyone's got a soul now.
  BUFFY
    He'll make a difference.

  ANGEL
    (mumbling) You know, I started it. The whole having a soul. Before it was 
    all the cool new thing.
  BUFFY
    Oh, my God. Are you 12?
  ANGEL
    I'm getting the brush off for Captain Peroxide. It doesn't necessarily bring 
    out the champion in me.

  BUFFY
    You're not getting the brush off. Are you just gonna come here and go all 
    Dawson on me every time I have a boyfriend?
  ANGEL
    Aha! (points) Boyfriend!
  BUFFY
    He's not. But...he is in my heart.

  ANGEL
    That'll end well. (walks away, leans on a tombstone)
  BUFFY
    What was the highlight of our relationship? When you broke up with me or when 
    I killed you? I'm well aware of my stellar history with guys... (sighs, leans 
    beside Angel) And, no, I don't see fat grandchildren in the offing with Spike, 
    but I don't think that really matters right now. (chuckles) You know, in the 
    midst of all this insanity, a couple things are actually starting to make 
    sense. And the guy thing— (sighs) I always feared there was something 
    wrong with me, you know, because I couldn't make it work. But maybe I'm not 
    supposed to. 
  ANGEL

    Because you're the slayer?
  BUFFY
    (looks at Angel) Because—OK, I'm cookie dough. I'm not done baking. I'm 
    not finished becoming whoever the hell it is I'm gonna turn out to be. I make 
    it through this, and the next thing, and the next thing, and maybe one day 
    I turn around and realize I'm ready. I'm cookies. And then, you know, if I 
    want someone to eat— (eyes go wide as she catches herself) or enjoy warm, 
    delicious cookie me, then...that's fine. That'll be then. When I'm done.
  ANGEL
    Any thoughts on who might enjoy— (sighs, irritated) Do I have to go with 
    the cookie analogy?

  BUFFY
    I'm not really thinking that far ahead. That's kind of the point.
  ANGEL
    (hands the amulet to Buffy) I'll go start working on the second front. Make 
    sure I don't have to use it. (walks away)
  BUFFY
    (calls after him) Angel. (he turns to look at her) I do... sometimes think 
    that far ahead.

  ANGEL
    Sometimes is something. (smiles, walks away)
  BUFFY
    Be a long time coming. Years, if ever.
  ANGEL
    (shrugs) I ain't getting any older. (walks away)

  10     INT.     DINING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Dawn is waiting by the front door when Buffy walks in. Buffy's surprised to 
    see her. Dawn kicks Buffy in the shin.
  BUFFY
    Ow.

  DAWN
    Dumbass.
  Buffy looks over at Xander, who's in the dining room with Anya, Giles, 
    and Willow.
  XANDER
    Don't look at me. This is a Summers' thing. It's all very violent.
  BUFFY

    (looks at Dawn) If you get killed, I'm telling. (walks into the dining room; 
    Dawn follows)
  WILLOW
    Did you find out anything about the scythe?
  BUFFY
    It slices, dices, and makes julienne preacher. 
  GILES

    Caleb?
  BUFFY
    I cut him in half.
  WILLOW
    All right!
  ANYA

    He had that coming.
  XANDER
    Hey, party in my eye socket and everyone's invited. (everyone stares at Xander) 
    Sometimes I shouldn't say words.
  Cut to:
  11     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

    Spike is in the basement punching a punching bag when Buffy walks down the 
    stairs.
  SPIKE
    So...where's tall, dark and forehead?
  BUFFY
    (rolls her eyes) Let me guess. You can smell him.
  SPIKE

    Yeah, that and I also used my enhanced vampire eyeballs to watch you kissing 
    him.
  BUFFY
    (awkwardly) It was...a hello.
  SPIKE
    Most people don't use their tongues to say hello. Or I guess they do, but—
  BUFFY

    There were no tongues. Besides, he's gone.
  SPIKE
    Oh, just popped by for a quickie, then?
  BUFFY
    (walks away) Good, good. I haven't had quite enough jealous vampire crap for 
    one night.
  SPIKE

    He wears lifts, you know.
  Buffy looks over at the punching bag that Spike was hitting and sees something 
    has been taped to it: a sketch drawn in black marker on white paper, shows 
    hair that sticks straight up, X's for eyes and fangs on the frowny face. Buffy 
    rolls her eyes at the representation of Angel.
  BUFFY
    You know, one of these days I'm just gonna put you 2 in a room and let you 
    wrestle it out.
  SPIKE
    (rifling through an empty cigarette package) No problem at this end. (throws 
    the package away in disgust)

  BUFFY
    (her eyes widen with excitement) There could be oil of some kind involved.
  SPIKE
    (walks up to Buffy) Where's the trinket?
  BUFFY
    The who-ket?

  SPIKE
    The pretty necklace your sweetie-bear gave you. The one with all the power. 
    I believe it's mine now.
  BUFFY
    How do you figure?
  SPIKE
    Someone with a soul, but more than human? Angel meant to wear it, that means 
    I'm the qualified party. (holds out his hands)

  BUFFY
    It's volatile. We don't know—
  SPIKE
    You'll be needing someone strong to bear it, then. You planning on giving 
    it to Andrew?
  BUFFY
    (looks at the amulet, then at Spike) Angel said the amulet was meant to be 
    worn by a champion. 

  Spike looks down, disappointed, but Buffy walks forward and hands it to 
    him.
  SPIKE
    Been called a lot of things in my time.
  BUFFY
    (coyly) Faith still has my room.
  SPIKE

    Well, you're not staying here. You can't buy me off with shiny beads and sweet 
    talk. You got Angel breath. I'm not gonna just let you whack me back and forth 
    like a rubber ball. I've got my pride, you know.
  BUFFY
    I understand. (turns to walk away)
  SPIKE
    (cuts her off) Clearly you don't, 'cause the whole "having my pride" 
    thing was just a smokescreen.

  BUFFY
    (sighs with relief) Oh, thank God.
  SPIKE
    I don't know what I would have done if you'd have gone up those stairs.
  Later, Buffy and Spike are lying together on the cot, fully clothed. Spike 
    has his arm around Buffy and she fondles his hand. He rolls over, removing 
    his arm from her, and she sits up. She stands and paces around the basement. 
    She is looking out the window, staring at the night sky when Caleb/First appears.
  CALEB/FIRST

    Pretty, ain't it?
  BUFFY
    You're not him.
  CALEB/FIRST
    No, you killed him right and proper. Terrible loss. This man was my good right 
    arm. 'Course, it don't pain me too much. Don't need an arm. Got an army.
  BUFFY

    An army of vampires. However will I fight—
  CALEB/FIRST
    Every day our numbers swell. But then you do have an army of your own. Some 
    thirty-odd pimply-faced girls, don't know the pointy end of a stake. (feigns 
    concern) Maybe I should call this off.
  BUFFY
    Have you ever considered a cool name? I mean, since you're incorporeal and 
    basically powerless. How about "The Taunter?" Strikes fear in the 
    heart—

  CALEB/FIRST
    I will overrun this Earth. And when my army outnumbers the humans on this 
    Earth, the scales will tip and I will be made flesh.
  BUFFY
    Talk on. I'm not afraid of you. 
  CALEB/FIRST
    (rolls eyes) Then why aren't you asleep in your dead lover's arms? (looks 
    over at Spike) 'Cause he can't help you. Nor Faith, nor your friends, certainly 
    not your wanna-slay brigade. None of those girlies will ever know real power 
    unless you're dead. You know the drill: (morphs into Buffy's form)

  BUFFY/FIRST
    Into every generation, a slayer is born. One girl in all the world. She alone 
    will have the strength and skill to— There's that word again. What you 
    are. How you'll die. Alone. Where's your snappy comeback?
  BUFFY
    You're right.
  BUFFY/FIRST

    Hmm. Not your best.
  SPIKE
    (talking in his sleep) I'm drowning in footwear! (sits up with a start; Buffy 
    turns to look at him and Buffy/First disappears) Weird dream. (notices Buffy 
    standing in the middle of the room) Buffy? Is something wrong?
  BUFFY
    No. Yeah. I just realized something. Something that really never occurred 
    to me before. We're gonna win.
  Fade to black.

  ACT II:
  12     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Close-up of Dawn, Xander, Anya, and Willow staring incredulously at Buffy. 
    Pan out to show that we were seeing their reflection in the mirror beside 
    Buffy. Buffy's looking at all of them. 
  BUFFY
    What do you think?

  XANDER
    That depends. Are you in any way...kidding?
  BUFFY
    You don't think it's a good idea?
  FAITH
    (standing on the opposite side of the mirror from Buffy) It's pretty radical, 
    B.

  GILES
    (sitting by the window) It's a lot more than that. (stands) Buffy, what you 
    said, it—it flies in the face of everything we've ever—every generation 
    has ever done in the fight against evil. (smiles) I think it's bloody brilliant.
  BUFFY
    You mean that?
  GILES

    If you want my opinion.
  BUFFY
    I really do.
  WILLOW
    Whoa, hey. Not to poop on the party here, but I'm the guy that's gonna have 
    to pull this thing off.
  FAITH

    It is beaucoup d'mojo.
  WILLOW
    This goes beyond anything I've ever done. It's a total loss of control, and 
    not in a nice, wholesome, my girlfriend has a pierced tongue kind of way.
  Dawn looks at Willow. Giles looks away.
  BUFFY
    I wouldn't ask if I didn't think you could do it.

  WILLOW
    I—I'm not sure that I'm stable enough.
  GILES
    You can do this, Willow. We'll get the coven on the line, and we'll find out 
    how they can help.
  DAWN
    Oh! (nods) "Pierced tongue."

  BUFFY
    (panicky) Dawn needs to do a research thing.
  GILES
    (quickly) Yes, you do.
  DAWN
    (rolls her eyes) It's cool. (stands, walks out) Watcher junior to the library.

  GILES
    I'll go dig up my sources. Quite literally, actually. (walks out of the room)
  ANYA
    (to Xander) Come on, let's go assemble the cannon fodder.
  XANDER
    That's not what we're calling them, sweetie. (walks out) 

  ANYA
    (walks out) Not to their faces. What, am I insensitive?
  Buffy hands the scythe over to Willow. Faith is standing beside Buffy.
  Cut to:
  13     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY

    Buffy addresses a room full of potentials and her friends. 
  BUFFY
    I hate this. I hate being here. I hate that you have to be here. I hate that 
    there's evil, and that I was chosen to fight it. I wish, a whole lot of the 
    time, that I hadn't been. I know a lot of you wish I hadn't been either. (Kennedy 
    and Rona look away) But this isn't about wishes. This is about choices. I 
    believe we can beat this evil. Not when it comes, not when its army is ready, 
    now. Tomorrow morning I'm opening the seal. I'm going down into the hellmouth, 
    and I'm finishing this once and for all. Right now you're asking yourself, 
    "what makes this different? What makes us anything more than a bunch 
    of girls being picked off one by one?" It's true none of you have the 
    power that Faith and I do. So here's the part where you make a choice.
  Cut to:
  14     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY

    Faith and Robin Wood are moving furniture around.
  ROBIN
    It's one hell of a risky idea.
  FAITH
    Buffy's wacky that way.
  ROBIN

    Yeah. There's one more vent right by the stairs. We block that, they got no 
    sewer access, should drive them straight up into the school proper.
  FAITH
    That's assuming they get past us.
  ROBIN
    Which, no offense, I am.
  FAITH

    Come on, you gotta have a little Faith.
  ROBIN
    (under his breath) I think I've had my share, thanks.
  FAITH
    Well, I trundled right into that one, didn't I? Look, I'm sorry if it seemed 
    like I was blowing you off the other day. I was just trying to, you know, 
    blow you off.
  ROBIN

    Yeah, you know what, I figured that one out all by myself.
  FAITH
    It's nothing personal. It's just after I get bouncy with a guy, there's not 
    that much more I need
    to know about him.
  ROBIN
    That's bleak.

  FAITH
    Way of the world.
  ROBIN
    That's good to know 'cause for a second there I thought it was more defensive,

  FAITH
    (laughs) And he comes out swinging.

  ROBIN
    Faith, there's a whole world out there that you don't even know about, and 
    a lot of the men in it are pretty decent guys. They'd surprise you.
  FAITH
    (shrugs) Guy looks at me, let's just say his priorities shift. 
  ROBIN
    Why, because you're so hot?

  FAITH
    It's what it is, yo.
  ROBIN
    Oh, please. I am so much prettier than you are. (Faith seems taken aback) 
    Oh, and, uh, for the record, our little encounter didn't exactly change my 
    world.
  FAITH
    You're tripping! That was rock 'em, sock 'em!

  ROBIN
    No, no, no, no. It was—it was—it was nice enough, you know, and 
    you're—you're very, um... mm, enthused, and I think with a little more 
    experience—
  FAITH
    Dude, I got mad skills.
  ROBIN

    Yeah, of course. Let's finish up.
  FAITH
    No, hell with that. We're going again, baby. (starts unbuckling her belt) 
    You're gonna learn a little respect here, pal.
  ROBIN
    Faith— (chuckles) Make me a deal, all right? We live through this, you 
    give me the chance to surprise you.

  FAITH
    What would be the surprise?
  ROBIN
    (looks at her) You do know the meaning of the word, right?
  FAITH
    Fine. (rebuckles her belt) Deal.

  ROBIN
    Good enough.
  FAITH
    No way you're prettier than me.
  ROBIN

  WILLOW
    I really wish she hadn't said that about me.

  KENNEDY
    What, the thing Buffy said? I think it's true. (Willow squeaks with uncertainty) 
    I'll be with you. To keep you grounded. 
  WILLOW
    Yeah, well, you might have to keep me stab-ded, if I go to the bad place.
  KENNEDY
    (sits up, looks at Willow) You're saying I might have to kill you.

  WILLOW
    I am.
  KENNEDY
    Bite me.
  WILLOW
    I will. I mean, I do... mean it. The darkest place I've ever been, this is 
    what lies beyond that. This is too important for me to—

  KENNEDY
    Buffy believes in you.
  WILLOW
    You know, Buffy: sweet girl, not that bright.
  KENNEDY
    Hey, I'm the first one to call her out when she's not making sense. In fact, 
    this may have escaped your keen notice, but I'm kind of a brat. I've always 
    sort of gotten my way. So you're gonna make it through this, no matter how 
    dark it gets. Because now... you're my way.

    Adios to 5 hit points. Trogdor has badly wounded you.

  XANDER
    Smackdown on Red Riding Hood. This could get ugly.
  GILES

  WILLOW
    Nothing strenuous.
  XANDER
    Well, mini-golf is always the first thing that comes to mind.
  GILES
    I think we can do better than that.

  BUFFY
    I was thinking about shopping. As per usual.
  WILLOW
    Oh! There's an Arden B. in the new mall!
  XANDER
    I could use a few items.

  GILES

    well. Faith takes out a few Turok-Han, as does another slayer. Vi takes out 
    one after another after another. Kennedy disarms one and dusts another. Buffy

    Kennedy helps the weakened Willow walk. Xander and Dawn are making their way 
    out of the building as well. As the building falls down around them, Xander 
    screams out for Anya.
  XANDER
    Anya! Anya!
  He doesn't see her body lying limp and lifeless on the floor beneath some 
    rubble. Dawn pulls him away toward the exit.

  Cut to:
  42     INT.     HELLMOUTH 
    - DAY
    Buffy and Spike are the only ones left in the hellmouth. Spike is still glowing 
    from the amulet, sending rays of light out into the hellmouth. Buffy stands 
    in front of him, staring, still holding her scythe. 
  SPIKE
    Go on, then.

  BUFFY
    No. No, you've done enough. You could still—
  SPIKE
    No, you've beat them back. It's for me to do the cleanup.
  The walls are crumbling around them. 
  FAITH

    (calls down to Buffy) Buffy, come on!
  SPIKE
    Gotta move, lamb. I think it's fair to say school's out for bloody summer.
  BUFFY
    (worried) Spike!
  SPIKE

    I mean it! I gotta do this. (holds out his hand to stop her)
  Buffy laces her fingers through Spike's, and they burst into flame together.
  BUFFY
    (softly, looks into his eyes) I love you.
  SPIKE
    No, you don't. But thanks for saying it. (another earthquake; Buffy lets go 
    of his hand) Now go! (Buffy runs up the stairs) I wanna see how it ends.

  Cut to:
  43     EXT.     SUNNYDALE 
    HIGH - DAY
    The school building explodes. Faith runs out from the cloud of smoke and jumps 
    into the bus. The bus drives off with all the survivors, except Spike and 
    Buffy. Dawn stares ut the back window of the bus. 
  Cut to:
  44     INT.     HALLWAY 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY

    Buffy runs through the hallway, still carrying the scythe, avoiding the debris 
    that has fallen to the floor as well as what's still falling as the ground 
    continues to shake. The door is blocked, so Buffy goes upstairs. 
  Cut to:
  45     INT.     HELLMOUTH 
    - DAY 
    Spike stands in the crumbling hellmouth with light shining down on him from 
    above, grinning from ear to ear and laughing as he burns up from the sunlight. 
    He dusts slowly—first his skin singes, then his muscles, then his bones—then 
    he's gone. The hellmouth crumbles in around him. 
  Cut to:

  46     INT.     SCHOOL 
    BUS - DAY
    Those who are less injured tend to the badly injured survivors on the bus. 
    Vi tends to Rona. Xander takes care of an Asian girl. 
  VI
    (grabs Rona's face) Look at me! This is nothing! Stay awake! This is nothing!
  ANDREW

    (staring straight ahead, in shock) Why didn't I die?
  Dawn looks out the back window of the bus, searching. 
  Buffy is running along the rooftops of the shopping mall as the bus drives 
    down the street. The buildings are collapsing behind her as she tries to catch 
    up to the bus. She leaps from building to building, still carrying the scythe, 
    then finally jumps toward the street, landing on the bus.
  Widen the shot vertically to show that the whole town is collapsing in 
    on itself, being sucked back into the Earth.
  FAITH
    (looks out the window) Ease off. We're clear.

  The bus screeches to a halt with Buffy still clinging to the top. Principal 
    Wood, who was driving even though he was wounded, turns the ignition off, 
    leans back in his chair and sighs.
  Cut to:
  47     EXT.     SCHOOL 
    BUS - DAY
    Buffy jumps down off the top of the school bus and looks around. Dawn opens 
    the emergency exit door at the back of the bus and jumps down to give Buffy 
    a warm hug. 
  GILES

    (looking around down the street behind them) I don't understand. Who did this?
  BUFFY
    Spike.
  As everyone who's able to gets off the bus, Buffy walks away from the 
    bus a few feet toward Sunnydale, which is now a vast cavern. The "Welcome 
    to Sunnydale" sign still stands, perched precariously on the edge of 
    the canyon. The sign teeters a little before falling backwards into the pit 
    that used to be its city. 
  XANDER

    (walks up to Andrew as he gets off the bus) So, did you see?
  ANDREW
    (can't look at Xander) I—I was scared. I'm sorry.
  XANDER
    Did you see what happened? I mean, was she...
  ANDREW

    (looks at Xander) She was incredible. She died saving my life.
  XANDER
    (puts his hand on Andrew's shoulder, nods) That's my girl. Always doing the 
    stupid thing.
  Andrew smiles a little. Xander walks away toward Buffy. 
  Cut to:
  48     INT.     SCHOOL 
    BUS - DAY

    Faith walks up to Robin Wood, who's slumped over in the driver's seat.
  FAITH
    It's not bad. You just sit here. I'll get someone to—
  ROBIN
    Hey... did we— did we make it?

  FAITH
    (kneels to be on eye-level with Robin) We made it. We won.
  Robin smiles and tries to laugh, but he's very weak. Still looking at 
    Faith, he goes silent and stops breathing. Faith gets concerned, pauses, then 
    reaches toward his face to close his eyelids. Robin coughs and sputters a 
    moment, then smiles weakly at her.
  ROBIN
    (breathing heavily) Surprise.
  Faith lets out a sigh of relief and a smile. Vi goes to Robin's side, 
    and Faith steps off the bus to join the others.

  Cut to:
  49     EXT.     SCHOOL 
    BUS - DAY
    Buffy is still staring at the canyon that once was Sunnydale. Dawn stands 
    beside her, then Giles joins them, as do Xander, Willow, and Faith. 
  FAITH
    Looks like the hellmouth is officially closed for business.

  GILES
    There is another one in Cleveland. Not to spoil the moment. (bends to pick 
    up a rock and throws it into the canyon)
  XANDER
    We saved the world.
  WILLOW
    We changed the world. (walks up to Buffy's side) I can feel them, Buffy. All 
    over. Slayers are awakening everywhere.

  DAWN
    We'll have to find them.
  WILLOW
    We will.
  GILES
    (paces behind them) Yes, because the mall was actually in Sunnydale, so there's 
    no hope of going there tomorrow.

  DAWN
    We destroyed the mall? I fought on the wrong side.
  XANDER
    All those shops gone. The Gap, Starbucks, Toys "R" Us. Who will 
    remember all those landmarks unless we tell the world about them?
  GILES

    We have a lot of work ahead of us.
  FAITH
    (to Willow) Can I push him in?
  WILLOW
    You've got my vote.
  FAITH

    I just want to sleep, yo, for like a week.
  DAWN
    I guess we all could, if we wanted to.
  WILLOW
    Yeah. (smiles) The First is scrunched, so... what do you think we should do, 
    Buffy?
  FAITH

    Yeah, you're not the one and only chosen anymore. Just gotta live like a person. 
    How's that feel?
  DAWN
    Yeah, Buffy. What are we gonna do now?
  As the others chatter around her, Buffy just stares straight ahead at 
    the hole formerly known as Sunnydale. As she contemplates what's next, she 
    smiles.
