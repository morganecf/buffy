  RECAP: (Skip Recap...)
  GILES (V.O.)
    Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
  1      INT.      ARCADE 
    - NIGHT
    Willow and Buffy are facing off against Warren, Andrew and Jonathan.
  WARREN
    We're your arch nemesises.
  Cut to:
  2      EXT.      WOODS 
    SOMEWHERE IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT
    Warren is strung up between a pair of trees. He is tied at four points, splayed 
    out like the famous DaVinci diagram. Warren calls for help.
  WARREN
    Somebody! Help!
  Willow, in full dark magic splendor (black hair, black eyes), motions 
    her hand toward Warren, and with a twist of her wrist, removes his skin. 
  Cut to:
  3      EXT.      CEMETERY 
    - NIGHT
    Jonathan and Andrew seize an opportunity to escape Xander's custody. 
  ANDREW
    We've got to get out of this town. Mexico. 
  Andrew and Jonathan run away.
  Cut to:
  4      INT.      LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Anya and Dawn are sitting on the couch. Xander's sitting in a cushy chair, 
    propping his feet up on the coffee table. Andrew's sitting on the floor between 
    Xander and the fireplace.
  ANYA
    Look, I'm not saying it's a happy scenario, but we're dealing with a big bad 
    that can be any dead person it wants. 
  Cut to:
  5      EXT.      SUNNYDALE 
    STREET - NIGHT
    Andrew, looking tough and menacing, is talking to Warren/First. 
  WARREN
    You know the rules. I can't take corporeal form. 
  ANDREW
    (sticks his hand through Warren/First's chest) I just don't think I can kill 
    anybody else. (shrugs)
  Cut to:
  6      INT.      BASEMENT 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT
    Jonathan is packing up his bag, when Andrew comes to him and puts his right 
    hand on Jonathan's shoulder. Jonathan looks up at Andrew, stands, and sees 
    Warren standing behind Andrew. Jonathan's eyes widen as Andrew takes his left 
    hand and stabs him in the belly with a dagger. Jonathan looks at Andrew and 
    Warren, hurt. Jonathan collapses onto the metal object that they unearthed. 
    
  Cut to:
  7      INT.      BUFFY'S 
    HOUSE - DAY
    Willow drags Andrew home with her. They come in through the front door, with 
    Andrew carrying the groceries from the butcher's shop. Xander, Dawn, and Anya 
    are in the living room. Xander's finishing installing the new window.
  WILLOW
    Look who I found. Guess who was buying mass amounts of blood at the butcher's 
    shop.
  Cut to:
  8      INT.      LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Buffy and Principal Wood walk through the front door to Buffy's house.
  BUFFY
    Andrew is our—actually, he's our hostage.
  ANDREW
    I like to think of myself more as a (makes quote marks in the air with his 
    mitted hands) "guestage."
  Cut to:
  9      INT.      BUFFY'S 
    HOUSE - DAY
    Buffy opens the front door to leave, but sees Giles standing there on her 
    front porch when she opens it. Buffy goes to hug Giles, but is cut off when 
    three girls she's never met walk right into her house.
  Cut to:
  10      INT.      LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Dawn's standing in front of the three girls Giles brought with him. The three 
    girls are lined up against the wall, and Dawn's inspecting them, arms crossed 
    in front of her. 
  DAWN
    They're all slayers?
  Cut to:
  11      EXT.      BACKYARD 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Buffy leads Principal Wood out to the back porch. Pan out to show that the 
    potential slayers are training in the backyard, being led by Kennedy.
  GILES (V.O.)
    Potential slayers. There were many more like them all over the world, but, 
    um, now there's just a handful.
  Cut to:
  12      INT.      PRINCIPAL 
    WOOD'S OFFICE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    While no one is looking, Buffy walks into the office labeled "Principal. 
    Robin M. Wood" on it and closes the door behind her. She looks through 
    files on his desk, then looks around the room. Buffy notices a wall cabinet, 
    and walks up to it. Before she can open it, Principal Wood walks into the 
    office.  
  ROBIN WOOD
    Uh, Buffy?
  BUFFY
    (turns to face him) Principal Wood. 
  ROBIN WOOD
    I'd like to take you out to dinner, if that's all right with you. 
  BUFFY
    (smiles) I'd be happy to have dinner with you.
  ROBIN WOOD
    Great. 
  Cut to:
  13      INT.      ROMANTIC 
    FRENCH RESTAURANT - NIGHT
    Buffy and Principal Wood are sitting across from each other at a small table 
    in a very elegant, romantic restaurant. 
  BUFFY
    How do you know about slayers?
  ROBIN WOOD
    My mother was one. She was killed when I was four. 
  BUFFY
    A demon—?
  ROBIN WOOD
    A vampire. 
  FLASHBACK: A very punk Spike is fighting with a young black woman in a 
    New York subway car. He overpowers her, and, straddling her on the floor, 
    he breaks her neck. Then he takes her leather duster and puts it on. (from 
    episode 5x07 "Fool For Love")

    The Start Of Episode
  
  PROLOGUE:
  14      INT.      LUXURIOUS 
    STUDY - NIGHT
    Classical violin music plays as the camera pans across the room. Show a wall 
    full of shelves stuffed with leather-bound books, a desk full of trinkets 
    of interest, such as skulls, quills, chemical bottles, an hourglass, and a 
    comic book laid open on a pedestal. A Star Wars poster hangs on the wall, 
    with action figures displayed on a shelf in front of it. There's a fire in 
    the fireplace beneath an elaborate mantelpiece, over which hangs an anime 
    poster and tribal masks. Pan over to Andrew who's sitting in a leather wing 
    chair wearing a silk smoking jacket, holding a pipe in his right hand and 
    an open book in his left. He's reading the book.
  ANDREW
    (looks up from his reading, chuckles) Oh, hello, there, gentle viewers. (closes 
    his book) You caught me catching up on an old favorite. (pats the book) It's 
    wonderful to get lost in a story, isn't it? (puts his hand to his chin) Adventure 
    and heroics and discovery—don't they just take you away? (puffs on the 
    pipe, but it makes him cough, so he sets it down in the crystal tray beside 
    his chair) Come with me now, if you will, gentle viewers. Join me on a new 
    voyage of the mind. A little tale I like to call: Buffy, Slayer of the Vampyrs. 
  
   
    Cut to:
    14a      EXT.      
      CEMETERY - NIGHT
      Buffy's patrolling the cemetery, and she hears something suspicious. 
    ANDREW (V.O.)
      It was cold last night, and the wind was crew-ell, but the Slayer had a 
      job to do. 
    A vampire attacks her from behind, but she flips onto a tombstone and 
      shoots him with a stake from her crossbow. He explodes into dust, but another 
      vampire goes for her. 
    ANDREW (V.O.)
      Unfortunately, vampires have a job to do, too. 
    She backflips off of the tombstone and lands on the ground, ready to 
      fight him in hand-to-hand combat. He pushes her against a tomb. 
  
  Cut to:
  ANDREW
    Ouch! My goodness! Things look bad for the Slayer, don't they? She didn't 
    see that second vampire, concealed by cover of darkness, ready— (there's 
    a knock at the door; Andrew ignores it) ready to attack and make her his own 
    vampirical spawn. 
  Cut to:
  15      INT.      UPSTAIRS 
    BATHROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Andrew's sitting on the closed toilet seat, talking to a camcorder. 
  ANDREW
    Let's rejoin them now to see—
  ANYA
    (opens the door) For God's sakes, Andrew. You've been in here for 30 minutes. 
    What are you doing?
  ANDREW
    Entertaining and educating. 
  ANYA
    Why can't you just masturbate like the rest of us?
  Andrew stares at her with an uncomfortable smile.
  Cut to:
  Opening Credits.
  ACT I:
  16      EXT.      CEMETERY 
    - NIGHT
    Resume the fight between Buffy and the vampire. The vampire charges her, but 
    she has a stake ready. Andrew was filming them from behind a nearby grave.
  ANDREW
    (runs up to Buffy, video camera in hand) That was great. I completely got 
    you dusting that guy on film. Hey, why do vampires show up on video?
  BUFFY
    (shown through the camcorder) I told you I didn't want you doing that. It's 
    distracting. (walks away)
  ANDREW
    (still taping, he walks beside her) OK, I'll cut the footage together and 
    do the intro tomorrow. "She was a woman in danger, or was she?"
  BUFFY
    Are you still filming me? Stop!
  ANDREW
    But it's a valuable record. An important document for the ages. "A Slayer 
    in action."
  BUFFY
    (leans toward Andrew) "A nerd in pain." Would they like that? 'Cause 
    we could do that. (walks away)
  Cut to:
  17      INT.      UPSTAIRS 
    HALLWAY AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Anya is dragging Andrew out of the bathroom by his collar. Meanwhile, there's 
    at least three girls lined up outside the bathroom door.
  ANDREW
    But the story needs to be told.
  ANYA
    (lets go of him) Birds need to fly, and girls need to use the toilet, and 
    why were you video taping yourself, anyway? Sounds like kinky business to 
    me.
  ANDREW
    The world's gonna want to know about Buffy. It's a story of ultimate triumph 
    tainted with the bitterness for what's been lost in the struggle. It's a legacy 
    for future generations.
  ANYA
    If there are any. Buffy seems to think that this apocalypse is going to actually 
    be, you know, apocalyptic. I think your—your story seems pretty pointless.
  ANDREW
    Oh, (looks away) I was gonna interview you later today, (stands close to Anya, 
    looking in her eyes) 'cause, you know, your whole perspective on the whole 
    thing. Give it editorial balance and, uh, (cocks his head to the side, looks 
    at her) glamour...
  ANYA
    (looks pensive, nods) Oh, well balance is important. People don't always take 
    that into account. I could bring that to you. Absolutely.
  Cut to:
  18      INT.      BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Viewed in "Play" mode on the camcorder, Andrew's in the basement 
    standing in front of the "Big Board" holding the remote control 
    for the video camera. It's propped up on the washer and dryer, and has been 
    erased and redrawn since last episode. Now, it's got a flaming red face in 
    the upper right quadrant, a depiction of a group of 5 harbingers in the lower 
    right quadrant, a drawing of a building in the upper left quadrant, and a 
    fiery mess with a black hole and a brown monster are in the lower left. Andrew 
    comes off as a novice presenter, fidgeting and stuttering frequently.
  ANDREW
    Let's explore the world of our story, shall we? This—uh, Buffy lives 
    in Sunnydale, California. (moves to the side so the whole board can be seen, 
    uses the remote to zoom the camera in as he points to the building with a 
    marker) Um, this is the local high school. 
  The video cuts to a zoomed-in shot of the lower left quadrant of the board. 
    It's labeled "HELLMOUTH" and has a depiction of the seal (in black) 
    and the brown monster drawn coming from the seal is labeled "UBERVAMP." 
    
  ANDREW
    There's a hellmouth—hellmouth—underneath the high school. See, weird 
    things happen on the hellmouth (zoom out) that attracts all sorts of, uh, 
    bad people and demons and vampires. And now there's this thing in the basement 
    of the high school called the-the seal of Danzal—Danzalthar, and it's 
    sort of a door to the hellmouth. (stands in front of the board, nervously) 
    Uh, due to some circumstances it got opened up... a little bit... recently...uh, 
    and this, uh, nasty, nasty vampire thing came out of it. It was, uh, it was 
    just awful, awful. This whole thing— (gestures in a circle with the marker) 
    whole thing—is being orchestrated by something called "The First". 
    It's made up of all the evil in the whole world. Oh, there's also these guys. 
    (points to the harbingers) They work for the First. We don't know much about 
    them except that they're very ugly and they're very mobile for blind people. 
    Is that all clear?
  Cut to:
  19      INT.      KITCHEN 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Andrew, with camcorder in hand, is video taping activity in the kitchen. The 
    room is full of people. 
  ANDREW
    It's morning in Sunnydale—
  RONA
    (looking in the fridge) Who the hell's got the low-fat milk?
  ANDREW
    It's morning in Sunnydale, and the women of command central take the time 
    to fortify themselves for the day ahead. (Kennedy and Willow pours themselves 
    each a bowl of cereal)
  XANDER
    (eating cereal from the box, scowls at Andrew) Hey!
  ANDREW
    Women and Xander. (puts the camera down for a moment) Hey, I'm gonna do your 
    special intro later. "The man who is the heart of the slayer machine."
  XANDER
    (smiles) Yeah? The heart? (blushes) 
  ANDREW
    (recording again, walks around the room) Things are tense in command central 
    this morning. Buffy is clearly concerned with some unknown danger, and the 
    air is filled with foreboding.
  DAWN
    (drying dishes) Oh, um, we're out of Raisin Bran. 
  ANYA
    I'll put it on the list.
  ANDREW
    That's probably not the unknown danger.
  SPIKE
    (walks into the kitchen) Look at this place. Damn girls' dorm is what it is. 
    (lights up a cigarette)
  DAWN
    That's nice. Second-hand stinkiness.
  ANDREW
    Full house. I think it's a good time to do some introductions, don't you, 
    gentle viewers?
  AMANDA
    (standing in front of Andrew, she waves and talks into the camera) I'm Amanda, 
    and I grew up right here—
  ANDREW
    (looks up from the camera) Not you, sweetheart. (mouths "sorry" 
    to Amanda) Let's start from the top. 
  Andrew narrates while the video shown is in a super-produced ultra-glamorous 
    style.
  ANDREW (V.O.)
    You've already met Buffy. (Buffy gracefully pours herself a bowl of cereal, 
    and shakes her hair sexily in the breeze that comes from nowhere, and looks 
    directly into the camera) She's beautiful, with a lion's heart and— (Buffy 
    winks) and the face of an Angel. She's never afraid 'cause she knows her side 
    will always win. (a shirtless Spike enters view, walking up to Buffy; they 
    look as if they will kiss, but don't; instead, he touches her waist, and Buffy 
    touches his arms as they nearly embrace) Buffy and Spike have some kind of 
    history—you can feel the heat between them. Although, technically, as 
    a vampire, he's room temperature. (flits sexily into view, crossing in front 
    of Spike and Buffy, twirling and eating from a bunch of grapes, then smiling 
    into the camera) Anya, a feisty waif with a firey temper and a vulnerable 
    heart that she hides, even from herself. (camera pans over to a blonde girl 
    eating from a bowl of cereal) This lovely girl—I don't remember her name—
  BUFFY
    (to Xander) Oh, for God's sake. Is he doing that again? Can't we make him 
    stop?
  RONA
    I don't know, if we save the world, it will be kind of nice to have a record 
    of it. (Buffy rolls her eyes) 
  AMANDA
    If we don't save the world, then... nothing matters.
  KENNEDY
    (pauses in her breakfast, spoon still in hand) That's catchy, Amanda. Let's 
    make that our slogan.
  XANDER
    Yeah, it is kinda strange, how you keep saving the world, and there's not 
    any proof.
  ANYA
    Yeah, you know, for future generations.
  WILLOW
    And it does help the girls with training—you know, viewing the tapes.
  BUFFY
    Come on. No one else thinks this is idiotic?
  XANDER
    Or is it important? I mean, Buff, I don't get why this is bothering you so 
    much.
  BUFFY
    Because it's a waste of time. Come on, someone has to agree with me. Spike?
  SPIKE
    Long as you're not pointing that thing at me, seems like a fine way to keep 
    the boy busy.
  BUFFY
    This isn't about keeping busy. This is about war. I'm sorry to jump all over 
    you guys, but... I have to tell you what's really going on. There's something 
    new. (Andrew walks around behind Buffy) Amanda, Dawn—you're gonna stay 
    home from school today. We can survive what's coming, but not like this. (Andrew 
    goes into the dining room, but Buffy continues talking) I had a vision of 
    what's to come—a horrible vision. Hundreds upon hundreds of....
  Cut to:
  20      INT.      DINING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    While Buffy talks in the other room, Andrew sets the video camera on the dining 
    room table and talks to it.
  ANDREW
    Honestly, gentle viewers, these motivating speeches of hers tend to get a 
    little long. I'll take you back in there in—in a little while, but in 
    the in-between time, I thought you might want to know a little about me, your 
    humble host. You see, I am a man with a burden. A man with a dark past. You 
    see, I was once a super villain.
   
    Cut to:
    20a      INT.      
      EVIL WORKSHOP - DAY
      An chemistry laboratory has been set up on the table, complete with bubbling 
      colored liquids in an elaborate set of interconnected tubes, vials and beakers. 
      Ultra-suave Andrew, in a black suit, black shirt, and black tie, is talking 
      to geeky Jonathan and Warren, who are dressed in jeans and t-shirts and 
      protective eye goggles..
    ANDREW
      Thus the validity of the Bronsted-Debye-Huckel equation at low ionic strength 
      has been amply tested, and the charges on the reactant ions are well-known, 
      if their reagents are properly characterized.
    JONATHAN
      (looks at Andrew) It smells funny. 
    ANDREW
      (looks at Jonathan)I know, kinda sweaty. (looks at the camera, squints)
    All three men turn around at once. Warren and Jonathan flank Andrew. 
      
    WARREN
      What'll it do to Buffy?
    ANDREW
      Make her super magnetic! (gestures emphatically with two fists)
    JONATHAN
      Wow, she won't be able to get out of her car.
    WARREN
      And knives and other sharp things will fly at her. (gestures like the knives)
    ANDREW
      We could walk right by her, and she wouldn't be able to stop us.
    WARREN
      (takes off his goggles, looks worried) Unless we were wearing metal belt 
      buckles, then we would stick to her.
    ANDREW
      In my plan, we are beltless.
    JONATHAN
      (takes off goggles) Wow, you're the best, Andrew.
    Andrew looks sexily into the camera as Warren and Jonathan fawn over 
      him.
    WARREN
      Yep, and good-looking and smart too.
    JONATHAN
      Yeah, wow.
  
  Cut to:
  ANDREW
    (looking into the camera) Warren was cool. And wasn't Jonathan just the cutest 
    thing? Well, shall we see if Buffy's still talking?
  Points the camera toward the kitchen. Buffy's back is in view, and Willow 
    can be seen facing Buffy. Willow yawns.
  BUFFY
    I mean mentally. And from what I've seen so far, there's is no way your girls 
    are ready. You have to...
  ANDREW
    She's not done. Even Willow looks bored, and she usually can take a lot of 
    that stuff. Look at her. (Kennedy walks up to Willow and cuddles while Buffy's 
    talking) Ooh, ooh, do you see that? That-that's important. Willow and Kennedy 
    have been in kind of a bad place lately, but things are looking up. You see, 
    Kennedy pursued the reluctant Willow and won her heart, only to find herself 
    frightened when she glimpsed the darkness that still lies within the witch's 
    mind. Side note—I once had my own personal encounter with Dark Willow.

      MAGIC BOX - DAY
      Andrew and Jonathan are having a face-off with Dark Willow.
    DARK WILLOW
      Jonathan, Andrew, you boys like magic, don't you? Abracadabra!
    Willow holds her hands out toward Jonathan and Andrew, and black light 
      shoots out of her palms toward them. A panicked Jonathan hides behind cool, 
      calm Andrew.
    JONATHAN
      (screams in fright) Yee!
    ANDREW
      Haltem!
    DARK WILLOW
      OK, didn't see that coming.
    ANDREW
      That's because we have power you can't imagine.
    JONATHAN
      (still hiding behind Andrew) We do?
    ANDREW
      You, Dark Willow, wield a force of mighty evil, it's true. But you are new 
      to the game, little one.
    DARK WILLOW
      You know what they say. If at first, you don't succeed...
    JONATHAN
      Holy cats! Here it comes again.
    ANDREW
      (calmly waves his hand) I deflect thy power.
    DARK WILLOW
      Damn, that is one effective counter spell.
    ANDREW
      Thank you, little one. Thank you.
  
  Cut to:
  ANDREW
    She was something. Indeed she was. Hey, I think Buffy stopped talking. That 
    usually means she had to go to work. Let's see what the little locusts left 
    for breakfast, shall we?
  Cut to:
  21      INT.      HALLWAY 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Buffy walks into the school, talking to herself. There's a lot of commotion 
    in the hallway.
  BUFFY
    (to herself) Not late. Not late 'til the bell rings. (looks up to see two 
    boys fighting, goes to break them up) Hey! Hey! (stands between them, pushing 
    them apart) Break it up! (bell rings) Get to class. (they go separate ways; 
    Buffy looks down the hall) Uh-oh. (a girl is fading away in front of the lockers, 
    Buffy goes up to her) Hey, shy girl, don't do this. Oh... (Buffy slaps the 
    girl)
  SHY GIRL
    (astonished) You knew I was there. 
  BUFFY
    Yeah.
  SHY GIRL
    You noticed me.
  BUFFY
    It's OK, I promise. It may seem ba— (a girl comes out of the bathroom 
    beside the lockers where Buffy's standing; the girl is sobbing) Wh-wh-what's 
    wrong?
  CRYING GIRL
    The mirror said I was fat. It said it. (walks off crying)
  Buffy watches the crying girl walk off, and her attention is pulled to 
    another conversation where a stressed boy is venting to his friends.
  STRESSED OUT BOY
    I'm so—I can't take this semester anymore. It's just so much for me to 
    handle. So, not only does Mr. Hildebrand move up the trig exam to today, but 
    he also makes it cover three more chapters. And I've got an English paper 
    due tomorrow. I feel like I'm gonna explode.
  BUFFY
    (walks up to the boy) Hey, uh, I can help. You just need to relax, you know? 
    (to his friends) You know, um, maybe one of you guys could give him a foot

    Buffy walks into the office area, only to see Principal Wood standing next 
    to the front desk holding an ice pack to his head.
  BUFFY
    Something bad is going on.
  ROBIN WOOD
    Oh, is that right?
  BUFFY
    (sits) Ooh, you're hurt. What happened?
  ROBIN WOOD
    Someone threw a rock at me as I got out of my car. I didn't really get a good 
    chance to see who.
  BUFFY
    (takes a bandage from the first-aid kit on the desk and unwraps it) Yeah, 
    well, it could have been any of them. Students, teachers—something is 
    going on today.
  ROBIN WOOD
    Yes, well, um, that occurred to me as I ducked the other two rocks. Buffy, 
    what the hell is this?
  BUFFY
    (puts the bandage on Wood's brow) Everything.
  ROBIN WOOD
    Slowly, I may be concussed here.
  BUFFY
    (shakes her head) There this thing that happens here, in this school, over 
    the hell mouth. Where the way a thing feels—it kind of starts being that 
    way...for real. I've seen all these things before...just not all at once.
  ROBIN WOOD
    So, what, it's like hell's a bustin' out all over?
  BUFFY
    Exactly.
  Insert a clip of Andrew standing in front of the "Big Board" 
    tapping a marker against the drawing of the hellmouth and nodding.
  ROBIN WOOD
    So, what's the worst that can happen?
  BUFFY
    War, pretty much.
  ROBIN WOOD
    Oh, I see you're being amusing now with comical exaggeration.
  BUFFY
    Being in high school can feel like being at war. Now it's true. The students 
    feel like the teachers are out to get them. The Chess Club resents the French 
    Club for taking the activities room, and, well, everybody hates the cheerleaders. 
    If we don't do something about this, we're gonna have a riot on our hands. 
    And a lot of other nasty stuff too. 
  ROBIN WOOD
    Like what?
  A boy in the hallway screams, increasingly louder, until he explodes off 
    screen, leaving bloody residue splattered all over the outside of the office 
    window.
  BUFFY

    and a smile that lights up the room.
  DAWN

    You've dealt with this before? I mean, you've seen stuff like this in a high 
    school?
  BUFFY
    Sure, you know, swim team monsters or killer prom dogs. Again, not all at 
    once.
  ROBIN WOOD
    So, what makes now so special?
  BUFFY
    My guess—it's that seal thing in the basement. It's like all the hellmouth's 
    energy is trying to escape in that one little spot, and it's getting all—

  Andrew sits in the chair across from the sofa, and repositions the camera 
    on the chair arm.
  ANYA
    That's what you're calling it?
  ANDREW
    Either that or "Buffy, the Slayer Who Knew No Fear."
  XANDER
    I like that one.
  ANDREW
    Thank you, Xander. That's sweet of you. (crosses his legs, gets his notepad 
    out) I understand that exactly one year ago today you left Anya at the altar. 
    Any comment on that?
  XANDER
    Whoa. What the hell?
  ANDREW
    I just think people will be interested.
  ANYA
    I know I am. (looks at Xander) What do you have to say for yourself one year 
    later?
  XANDER
    I've apologized enough, that's what I have to say.
  ANDREW
    But you think it was something that called for an apology?
  XANDER
    Well, yes.
  ANDREW
    So you don't think it was the right thing to do.
  ANYA
    Of course he doesn't think it was the right thing to do. (looks at Xander)
  XANDER
    (looks at Anya) It was the right thing to do.
  ANYA
    What?
  ANDREW
    Interesting. I think we're getting something here.
  XANDER
    Look, Anya, if I had married you, it would have been against everything I 
    thought was best. It wouldn't have worked.

    around the edge of it.
  BUFFY
    I swear we just covered this thing up.
  ROBIN WOOD
    It doesn't want to stay hidden anymore. It wants to turn these kids into monsters 
    and victims and who knows what.
  BUFFY
    It's more than that. Look, Robin, I, um, I had a vision the other day.
  ROBIN WOOD
    You have visions?
  BUFFY
    Sometimes. (nods)
  ROBIN WOOD
    Oh. Well, how do you know that they're not just dreams?
  BUFFY
    You're running to catch the bus naked? That's a dream. Army of vicious vampire 
    creatures? That's a vision. Also, I was awake.
  ROBIN WOOD
    A bus to where? I mean, an army of how many?
  BUFFY
    Hundreds. Maybe hundreds of hundreds. All I know is the last UberVamp I faced 
    crawled out of that very hole. (backs up) It makes me awfully nervous. (Robin 
    walks onto the seal) What are you doing?
  ROBIN WOOD
    Now, have you ever really studied it? You know, gotten close? (kneels on the 
    seal)
  BUFFY
    Well, I know it's a goat with its tongue out. Uh, Willow did a search on the 
    symbolic database, but it turns out everybody loves a good goat's tongue. 
    Rock groups, covens and greek cookbooks. She said she couldn't narrow it down.
  ROBIN WOOD
    (looks at Buffy) And you trust her? 
  BUFFY
    Yes, why wouldn't I trust her?
  ROBIN WOOD
    I don't know why any of you should trust each other. You've all been evil 
    at some point, right?
  BUFFY
    (shakes her head) No, that's not true. Yeah, Willow had a bad patch, but I've 
    never been.
  ROBIN WOOD
    (in a deep voice) Evil is what evil does, and I know what you're doing. (stands, 
    looks at Buffy—his eyes are white) You're with that vampire, screwing 
    that vampire. You filthy whore! (charges at Buffy)
  BUFFY
    (dodges Robin, who runs into the wall; Buffy goes to his side) Robin, are 
    you OK?
  ROBIN WOOD
    (panting) Whoa. What happened?
  BUFFY
    I—I think it was controlling you.
  ROBIN WOOD
    Buffy, we've got to get rid of this seal. We've got to shut it down before 
    it starts affecting everyone.
  BUFFY
    I think I have a pretty good idea who we should talk to.
  ROBIN WOOD
    Yeah, who's that?

  ANYA
    Doesn't seem likely.
  XANDER
    I guess I'm more replaceable, obviously.
  ANYA
    No. (Andrew is mouthing Anya's words as he watches the tape) There's no one 
    like you, Xander. You were willing to stand up to danger, even when your hands

      thing going. (walks closer to Andrew) Did you, uh, did you get the knife?
    ANDREW
      Yeah. It wasn't easy. I had to meet this demon guy who sells all kinds of

      Don't talk to me. I'm fine.
    ANDREW
      Pretty knife, except the, uh, the stabbing—I don't—I don't think 
      I can do it. Jonathan has been a good friend to me here in Mehico. He said 
      he'll buy me a burro.
    WARREN/FIRST
      Oh, you can stab him. It's all part of the plan. That boy's blood is a powerful

    really, really old.
  KENNEDY
    But, what's the big?

    We never knew anything about this seal. Now, we know this knife and this language 
    are connected to it somehow.
  WILLOW
    Andrew, do you speak Tawarick?
  ANDREW
    Yeah, I'm OK with it. It says, "The blood which I spill, I consecrate 
    to the oldest evil."

    Besides, it's the only thing we've got.

    one of the boys.
  BUFFY
    Spike! (he turns to look at Buffy) Don't kill them. They're just students.
  SPIKE
    They'll live. (punches the boy again)
  Buffy walks further down the hall and finds the basement entry door.
  BUFFY
    OK, Spike, Wood. I need you guys to stay here, hold our line of retreat.
  ANDREW
    So, I'll be staying here with these men, helping out that holding the line 
    thing. (Buffy frowns and grabs Andrew's arm) I'll be with Buffy.
  Cut to:
  35     INT.      BASEMENT 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT
    Buffy and Andrew go down the stairs into the basement.
  ANDREW
    (videotaping) We make our way down the stairs carefully, alert for any danger.
  BUFFY
    Oh, stop it. 
  ANDREW
    I was just—
  BUFFY
    (takes the camera from him) No more. (closes the camera) 
  ANDREW
    But I just—I just want the world to see what you do.
  BUFFY
    What I do is too important to show the world.
  ANDREW
    Ooh, I like that.
  BUFFY
    Be quiet! I don't want a biographer, especially a murderer.
  ANDREW
    Yeah, well, see, about that—we just keep tossing that word around, but 
    that's not really what happened. 
  BUFFY
    What? You stabbed Jonathan to death. What were you trying to do? Scratch his 
    back from the front?
  ANDREW
    It was confusing. Jonathan and I were digging, but Warren was there, and only 
    I could see him—
   
    Cut to:
    35a      INT.      
      BASEMENT AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT
      Andrew and Jonathan are uncovering the seal in the basement while Warren/First 
      watches.
    ANDREW
      Not one of them cares about you.
    JONATHAN
      But I care about them. That's why I'm here.
    WARREN/FIRST
      Do it. Stab him.
    ANDREW
      No, I can't do it.
    JONATHAN
      (stops digging) What? 
    WARREN/FIRST
      Do it now.
    ANDREW
      This isn't right.
    WARREN/FIRST
      Stab him. Spill the blood.
    JONATHAN
      Who are you talking to? What isn't right?
    WARREN/FIRST
      What's wrong with you? Are you a little coward?
    ANDREW
      No, but did you actually think I could use this? (pulls out the knife)
    WARREN/FIRST
      That good.
    JONATHAN
      A knife?
    WARREN/FIRST
      Just do it. It'll feel good.
    JONATHAN
      What's going on?
    ANDREW
      He's making me do it.
    JONATHAN
      (angrily) You tricked me. Damn you! I'll kill you first. (charges Andrew) 
      I'll kill you!
    WARREN/FIRST
      Stab him! You have to! If you fail, you'll die a lost soul, and I'll hate 
      you forever!
    Andrew and Jonathan fight, and Andrew accidentally stabs Jonathan.
    ANDREW
      (crying) No! (holds his hands up to the sky)
  
  Cut to:
  ANDREW
    See, I'm a man trapped by circumstances into paying for a crime I didn't even— 
    (Buffy mumbles) What?
  BUFFY
    No, I just thought you would say that. I saw the seal possess Wood like that 
    earlier today.
  ANDREW
    Yes. Yes. See...
  
    Cut to:
    35b      INT.      
      BASEMENT AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT
      Andrew and Jonathan are uncovering the seal in the basement.
    JONATHAN
      That's why I'm here.
    ANDREW
      (turns toward Jonathan, white-eyed, possessed, stabs Jonathan) Die. (stabs 
      him again) Die! (stabs him again) Die! (looks up and sees Warren/First watching 
      them, looks at the bloody knife) What have I done? (screaming) Get out of 
      my brain!!! Aaaah!
  
  Cut to:
  BUFFY
    You just completely changed your entire story.
  ANDREW
    Did not.
  BUFFY
    Uh, ya did too.
  ANDREW
    Did—uh, hey, here we are.
  There's chanting from the room with the seal in it.
  BUFFY
    There's someone in there. No. We're going in. Just be prepared, OK? The seal 
    could have done anything to them. Go. 
  Cut to:
  36     INT.      BASEMENT 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT
    Buffy and Andrew go into the seal room and see the five kids that were chanting 
    there before have now become Bringers, complete with the self-mutilation of 
    the eyes. They all turn to face Buffy. 
  BUFFY
    Nope, they're OK.
  Fade to black.
  ACT IV:
  37     INT.      BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Xander and Anya are lying in bed together naked on a cot in the basement. 
    Candles are lit around the room. They both seem out of breath.
  XANDER
    Wow.
  ANYA
    Wow, wow.
  XANDER
    That was nice.
  ANYA
    Certainly was, you carpenter you.
  XANDER
    It's too bad Buffy took Spike's chains down, huh?
  ANYA
    You said it.
  XANDER
    Mmm, I feel good.
  ANYA
    Well, yeah. I'm a spitfire in the bedroom.
  XANDER
    Yeah, I knew we'd always do that again.
  ANYA
    Yeah, one more time anyway.
  XANDER
    Is that what that was? (looks at Anya) One more time?
  ANYA
    Do you think there should be more?
  XANDER
    I don't know. It was nice. It felt, um—it felt like a one more time.
  ANYA
    I think maybe we're really over. Which is—it's good, right? I mean, now 
    we can move on. 
  XANDER
    Sure.
  Cut to:
  38     INT.      HALLWAY 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT
    Spike and Wood are still guarding the basement door. Spike's rummaging around 
    through the debris. 
  SPIKE
    Wonder what's keeping 'em. I thought they'd be up here by now. (picks up a 
    2x4 with a dozen nails sticking out of it) How'd they make this in here, you 
    suppose? (tosses it to Robin)
  ROBIN WOOD
    Wood shop, I guess. It's nice to know they're paying attention in class.
  Some kids jump Spike and Wood, starting a fight. While fighting them off, 
    Wood splinters the 2x4, breaking a shard off of it. Wood picks up the wood 
    fragment and eyes Spike, whose back it toward him as he fights off one of 
    the boys. Wood charges at Spike, wielding the makeshift stake, intending to 
    kill Spike, but one of the boys intercepts Wood and knocks him off balance. 
     
  Cut to:
  39     INT.      BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    The seal is glowing. Buffy fights off the new Bringers in the basement. Andrew 
    grabs the camcorder to videotape the fight.
  ANDREW
    (narrating) She's like a woman fighting for more than life. She fights like 
    fighting is her life. It's like the air she breathes, and she knows she will 
    win because there is no alternative.
  BUFFY
    (knocks out the last Bringer) It's your turn, Andrew. (pulls out the knife, 
    and walks toward Andrew)
  ANDREW
    (walks away from Buffy, around the seal) So, you figure, what? I, uh... (puts 
    down the camcorder) I stand on the seal, and hold the knife, and command it 
    to stop glowing in Tawarick?
  Buffy and Andrew are opposite each other across the seal. They are walking 
    in circles as Buffy tries to approach Andrew, he tries to maintain his distance.
  BUFFY
    Or we could do this?
  ANDREW
    What?
  BUFFY
    Doesn't really make sense, does it? Bringing you here to talk to it. This 
    thing doesn't understand words, it understands blood.
  ANDREW
    (nervous) Blood opens it. You don't want to open it. Opening it would be bad.
  BUFFY
    (flips the knife) Yeah, Willow did a little research. Turns out, the blood 
    of the person that awoke it—you—different kind of deal. It reverses 
    the whole thing.
  ANDREW
    So, how much blood...are you gonna—
  BUFFY
    I don't know. Maybe not enough to kill you.
  ANDREW
    (faces her, but still backs away) So, this is my redemption at last? I buy 
    back my bruised soul with the blood of my heart. But-but not enough to kill—
  BUFFY
    (standing right in front of him now, pointing the knife at him) Stop! Stop 
    telling stories. Life isn't a story.
  ANDREW
    (frightened) Sorry. Sorry.
  BUFFY
    Shut up. You always do this. You make everything into a story so no one's 
    responsible for anything because they're just following a script.
  ANDREW
    Please don't kill me. Warren said Jonathan would be OK. I trusted him, and 
    I lost my friend.
  BUFFY
    (angrily) You didn't lose him. You murdered him.
  ANDREW
    (softly, sincerely) I know, but you don't need to kill me. You said we could 
    all get through this.
  BUFFY
    I made it up. I'm making it all up. What kind of hero does that make me?
  ANDREW
    (shakes his head) No, you're doing great. Really. Kudos.
  BUFFY
    Yeah? Well, I don't like having to give a bunch of speeches about how we're 
    all gonna live, because we won't. This isn't some story where good triumphs 
    because good triumphs. Good people are going to die! Girls. Maybe me. Probably 
    you. Probably right now.
  ANDREW
    (shakes his head, frightened) Don't! Please! Don't, please!
  Buffy pushes him toward the seal; he leans over it, but she's holding 
    the back of his jacket so he doesn't fall. She's pointing the knife at him. 
    
  BUFFY
    When your blood pours out, it might save the world. What do you think about 
    that? Does it buy it all back? Are you redeemed?
  ANDREW
    (crying) No.
  BUFFY
    Why not?
  ANDREW
    (sobbing, his face is tear-streaked) Because I killed him. Because I listened 
    to Warren, and I pretended I thought it was him, but I knew—I knew it 
    wasn't. And I killed Jonathan. And now you're gonna kill me. And I'm scared, 
    and I'm going to die. And this—this is what Jonathan felt. 
  As Andrew's tears flow, a tear droplet falls from his face onto the seal 
    below. It immediately stops glowing. Buffy lets Andrew go. He falls to the 
    ground and puts the knife down.
  ANDREW
    It stopped.
  BUFFY
    Didn't want blood. It wanted tears.
  ANDREW
    (stands) Thanks.
  BUFFY
    Sorry, I had to—
  ANDREW
    You—you weren't really going to stab me, were you?
  BUFFY
    I wasn't going to stab you.
  ANDREW
    What if the tears didn't work?
  Buffy walks out of the room. Andrew grabs his camcorder and follows her.

  40     INT.      HALLWAY 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT
    Robin and Spike are fighting students, but suddenly the students stop fighting 
    back. Instead, they just walk away.
  ROBIN WOOD
    She got it done.
  SPIKE
    Always has. 
  ROBIN WOOD
    So far.
  Cut to:
  41     INT.      UPSTAIRS 
    BATHROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Through the camera lens, show Andrew sitting on the closed toilet seat, recording 
    himself as before.
  ANDREW
    Here's the thing. I killed my best friend. There's a big fight coming, and 
    I don't know what's going to happen. I don't even think I'm going to live 
    through it. (looks down) That's, uh, probably the way it should be. I guess 
    I'm— (looks at the camera, sighs, points the remote control, presses 
    a button, and turns it off)
