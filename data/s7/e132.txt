  GILES (V.O.)
    Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer
  1a     EXT.     CITY 
    STREET IN ISTANBUL, TURKEY - NIGHT
    A dark-haired girl is running through the arched hallway, looking over her 
    shoulder and panting from the exertion of running so fast. She's being chased. 
    Two people in hooded cloaks are chasing her. 
  1b     INT.     PARKING 
    GARAGE IN FRANKFURT, GERMANY - NIGHT
    A girl with hot pink hair with black bangs at her forehead, a nose ring, and 
    a metal collar is trying to escape her pursuers. Finally, she thinks she's 
    safe when she goes through a doorway to the outside near a crowd of club patrons, 
    but she is pushed back inside. Robed men close the door behind them and start 
    to fight with her. She is knocked to the ground, lying on her back. Finally, 
    one of the robed people pulls out a Jambaya (curved silver dagger) and stabs 
    her.
  Cut to:
  2     INT.     FLAT 
    IN ENGLAND - DAY
    Giles enters the flat and sees Robson, who's found near a chair in the next 
    room. Giles goes to his side.
  GILES
    Robson! (takes off his glasses and starts to cry) Dear God, I thought you—
  ROBSON
    (eyes flash open) Gather them. 
  GILES
    I understand—
  One of the robed men sneaks up behind Giles wielding a battle-axe. He 
    swings it at Giles.
  Cut to:
  3     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    HOUSE - NIGHT
    Dawn's sitting on the living room floor in front of the couch, hugging a pillow, 
    amid the destruction from her earlier encounter. Willow comes to talk to her.
  DAWN
    I saw Mom.
  WILLOW
    It's the Big Bad, Dawn. The one we knew was coming.
  Cut to:
  4     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT
    Jonathan is packing up his bag, when Andrew comes to him and puts his right 
    hand on Jonathan's shoulder. Jonathan looks up at Andrew, stands, and sees 
    Warren standing behind Andrew. Jonathan's eyes widen as Andres takes his left 
    hand and stabs him in the belly with a dagger. Jonathan looks at Andrew and 
    Warren, hurt. Jonathan collapses onto the metal object that they unearthed. 
    He bleeds profusely, with his blood filling the grooves in the object, as 
    Andrew and Warren stand there and watch. The metal object starts glowing.
  Cut to:
  5     EXT.     SUNNYDALE 
    STREET - NIGHT
    Show someone wearing black boots—someone's walking along the sidewalk. 
    Pan up: long black leather trench coat, blonde spiked hair. It's Andrew, looking 
    tough and menacing. Warren comes up to him and walks beside him.
  ANDREW
    I did what you told me. It's not my fault it didn't work. 
  WARREN
    I would do this stuff if I could.
   
    5a     INT.     BASEMENT 
      AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT
      Without any confusion, Principal Wood walks directly into the room where 
      the Seal of Danthazar is. Jonathan's body is still lying on top of the seal. 
      Principal Wood stares blankly, unflinching at the sight.
  
  ANDREW
    (sighs) I just don't think I can kill anybody else. (shrugs)
  Warren morphs into Jonathan.
   
    5b     EXT.     DESOLATE 
      OIL RIG SITE - NIGHT
      His work area lit by the headlights of his SUV, Principal Wood is digging 
      a hole. He stops, and rolls Jonathan's body into the shallow grave and throws 
      dirt over him.
  
  JONATHAN
    It's my fault the ritual didn't work. I don't have as much blood as other 
    people. 
  Cut to:
  6     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    HOUSE - DAY
    Willow drags Andrew home with her. They come in through the front door, with 
    Andrew carrying the groceries from the butcher's shop. Xander, Dawn, and Anya 
    are in the living room. Xander's finishing installing the new window.
  WILLOW
    Look who I found. Guess who was buying mass amounts of blood at the butcher's 
    shop.
  Cut to:
  7     INT.     DAWN'S 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Xander pushes Andrew into a chair and ties his wrists to it, in a similar 
    fashion to Spike's restraints. Anya's standing in front of Andrew, going through 
    his leather trench coat.
  XANDER
    Just tell us what you know. (tightens restraint)
  ANDREW
    Ow. 
  Cut to:
  8     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Spike is lying on the floor in shackles, both hands and feet chained to the 
    wall. His eyes are closed. Buffy walks downstairs with a bowl of water and 
    goes over to him. She dips a towel in the water and washes the blood off of 
    his face. 
  BUFFY
    (in his face) I believe in you, Spike. 
  Spike looks at her with a face full of hope and amazement. Just then, 
    the lights flicker and go out. Someone bursts into the basement and pushes 
    Buffy away from Spike. She falls to the ground.
  Cut to:
  9     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    HOUSE - NIGHT
    Robed men break into the house from all angles, smashing windows and breaking 
    down doors. Covered head to toe in long, black, hooded robes, these people 
    have batons and no eyes
  Cut to:
  10     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Buffy goes down the stairs to the basement, followed by Xander. She stops 
    dead in her tracks when she sees the empty shackles that Spike was supposed 
    to be in.
  BUFFY
    They were after Spike all along.
  Cut to:
  11     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - NIGHT
    Spike is tied to the wheel-like construct with all four corners of his body 
    pulled in opposite directions. Spike's body has symbols carved into his chest. 
    Spike/First morphs into Buffy's form. A Harbinger cranks a wheel attached 
    to a mechanism that hoists the wheel Spike's tied to into the air. Spike is 
    now hanging from the wheel about ten feet from the ground, bleeding steadily 
    from his ritualized symbol-shaped cuts.
  BUFFY/FIRST
    I'm getting a little tired of subtle. It's about time we bring some authority 
    to our presence. Now, Spike, wanna see what a real vampire looks like?
  Spike's blood is falling on the Seal of Danthazar that's right below him. 
    It's pooling in the grooves and being absorbed into the seal. The seal starts 
    to glow. One by one, the pointed tips of the pentagram at its center fold 
    up, forming a pyramid. Light comes out from under it. The pyramid sinks into 
    the ground. The remaining pieces of the seal follow suit. Spike glares at 
    Buffy/First, then watches the hole where the seal is. Something sticks it's 
    withered, gray, pointy-fingered hand out of the hole. A monster climbs out 
    wearing black leather. Pan up to show its horrible disfigured face. It's bald 
    with a distinct vampire forehead and brows and trademark fanged teeth. It 
    looks gaunt, with extremely hollow cheekbones. It raises its hands toward 
    the sky and looks around the room, growling menacingly.
  Fade to black.

    The Start Of Episode
  
  PROLOGUE:
  12     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
    Someone's sweeping up broken glass from the floor. Pan up to show it's Xander. 
    He stops and addresses the room. Buffy's doing research at the dining room 
    table, sitting next to Willow who is using her laptop computer. Anya and Dawn 
    are on the couch in the living room looking through books.
  XANDER
    (exasperated) It's a loop...like the Mummy Hand. I'm doomed to replace these 
    windows for all eternity. You know, maybe we should just board these up until 
    things are less hellmouthy.
  ANYA
    (holds up a notebook she was reading) Nothing...and nothing. (holds up two 
    other books, one in each hand) Cliff Notes to nothing. Nothing abridged...
  WILLOW
    (looks up from her computer) Yeah, my search isn't turning anything up either. 
    (to Buffy) Are you sure this thing called itself The First?
  BUFFY
    Pretty sure. It claimed to be the original evil, the one that came before 
    anything else.
  ANYA
    (looking up over her reading glasses) Please, how many times have I heard 
    that line in my demon days? "I'm so rotten, they don't even have a word 
    for it. I'm bad. Baddy bad bad bad. Does it make you horny?" (everyone 
    stares at her) Or terrified. Whatever.
  BUFFY
    It wasn't a line. When I came up against this thing, I felt it. It was ancient 
    and enormous. It nearly got Angel to kill himself. And if we don't rescue 
    Spike soon, God only knows what the First'll get him to do.
  XANDER
    (looks over at Andrew, who's passed out, tied to a chair) I wish Sleeping 
    Ugly would come to. He's been out all night.
  ANYA
    Yes, he was just starting to squeal when the spooky SWAT attacked. Said The 
    First was held up at the Seal of...Danzar something?
  DAWN
    (stands, walks to Andrew) Hmm. Maybe he's just faking so he doesn't have to 
    answer any more questions. (punches him in the face, stands back to observe) 
    Hm. Or maybe he's in a fugue state.(rears back to punch him again, but Buffy 
    interrupts)
  BUFFY
    Dawn. 
  DAWN
    What?
  BUFFY
    He'll come to when he comes to. Keep reading. If we're gonna rescue Spike, 
    we need to figure out how to fight this thing.
  DAWN
    (pouts, goes back to the couch) Anya gets to hit him.
  WILLOW
    Hey! Here, The First!...Bank of Delaware. Sorry.
  BUFFY
    (sighs) Hand me the Watchers' Codex again. (someone hands her an old-looking 
    book)
  JOYCE
    Can I get you anything else, baby? (Buffy recognizes the voice and turns to 
    look) How 'bout some tea?
  BUFFY
    (searching her, shocked) Mom? (sighs, closes eyes) You're not real.
  JOYCE
    (bends to Buffy's eye level) OK, is that, uh, slang, like you're not for real, 
    or—?
  BUFFY
    (looks her in the eyes) You're The First.
  JOYCE
    Oh, baby, you're so tired, you're not making sense. Maybe you should get some 
    sleep.
  BUFFY
    No.
  JOYCE
    You can't win against this thing. Not if you don't rest.
  BUFFY
    (visibly shaken) Stop. Stop being like this. It's a lie.
  JOYCE
    I don't want to scare you, but I want you to take care. (slowly) You need 
    to wake up.
  BUFFY
    What?
  XANDER (O.S.)
    You're dreaming. Buff, wake up.
  BUFFY
    (having fallen asleep at the dining room table, she wakes) Hm? Did you see 
    it? (looks around)
  XANDER
    There's nothing to see. You were just doing a little dream talking, that's 
    all.
  BUFFY
    Oh.
  XANDER
    You OK? What'd you see?
  BUFFY
    (shakes head) Nothing. It was nothing.
  Cut to:
  13     INT.     UNDERGROUND 
    CAVE - NIGHT
    In the background, chanting in Latin can be heard. Spike is being dragged, 
    face up, along the dirt ground. His chest wounds have started to close, but 
    the symbols cut into him remain clear on his chest. Spike looks around, a 
    little disoriented, and sees Harbingers with torches and someone dragging 
    him. It's the UberVamp dragging Spike into a special room. The UberVamp stops, 
    lets go of Spike's leg, and stares at him. Spike/First walks into the room.
  SPIKE/FIRST
    Go on. Give it a kick then. You always liked that, didn't you?
  Spike/First morphs into Drusilla's form.
  DRUSILLA/FIRST
    Kick a dolly when he's down. That was always your style. 
  Drusilla/First kneels to watch UberVamp kick Spike in the ribs so hard 
    he rolls over. Spike lifts his head to glare angrily at the UberVamp. The 
    UberVamp hisses and growls at Spike.
  DRUSILLA/FIRST
    Has buckets of energy, poor dear. He's been laying in wait for his moment 
    since before the bug walked. (stands, walks to UberVamp) There, there, pet. 
    (clicks tongue) Soon as the moon comes, you'll have your carnage. (looks at 
    Spike) Little girls tear so easily, like pink paper. 'Til then, we'll have 
    our way with this one. Got it coming, he does. (hums)
  The UberVamp goes back to Spike, kicking him. Spike screams.
  Fade to black.
  ACT I:
  14     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    LIVING ROOM - DAY
    Show Andrew, still passed out and tied to a chair in the living room. Someone 
    splashes water in his face. He shudders a little, but doesn't regain consciousness. 
    Show Dawn and Anya standing there looking at him. Anya's got a cup in her 
    hand.
  ANYA
    That was something.
  DAWN
    (to Anya) Maybe if you threw hot water on him.
  ANYA
    Good thinking.
  Dawn and Anya walk toward the kitchen, but Buffy comes into the room, 
    so they go sit on the couch instead.
  ANYA
    Whoa, hey.
  DAWN
    Hi. (Buffy stares at them, but they avoid eye contact) Nothing.
  BUFFY
    What?
  DAWN
    (wringing hands) Oh, um, I thought you were gonna ask us what we were doing.
  BUFFY
    No, was going to ask—
  DAWN
    (Andrew coughs) Oh! Look who's awake. (stands and goes to Andrew)
  ANYA
    (follows Dawn) Silly Andrew, (slaps his chin gently) you drooled all over 
    yourself.
  ANDREW
    (to Buffy) I'm—I was about to be dead. You saved me.
  BUFFY
    (steps up between Dawn and Anya) For the time being. (crosses arms) But if 
    you don't tell us what we need to know, then I'm gonna offer you to The First 
    on a platter and let him chop you into tiny pieces.
  ANDREW
    The first what?
  ANYA
    The name of the evil thing that pretended to be Warren to get you to kill 
    Jonathan.
  ANDREW
    Oh, not very ominous sounding.
  DAWN
    No, i-it is if you understand the context.
  ANDREW
    No, an evil name should be like Lex or Voldemort or—
  BUFFY
    Hey, I was intimidating here. (flanking Buffy, Dawn and Anya turn and glare 
    at Andrew)
  ANDREW
    Oh, sorry. Um, go ahead.
  BUFFY
    (sighs) Forget it. Where's the seal?
  Cut to:
  15     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Buffy, Dawn and Xander are following Andrew through the school basement. 
  ANDREW
    It's around this corner, I think.
  BUFFY
    You better be right this time.
  ANDREW
    I told you—I'm not sure.
  Cut to:
  16     INT.     SEAL 
    OF DANTHAZAR ROOM IN BASEMENT AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Andrew leads Buffy, Dawn, and Xander to the room where he killed Jonathan.
  XANDER
    Maybe you should get sure. I'm sick of all the runaround with you— (sees 
    the seal of Danthazar) Whoa. Check out the goat-heady badness.
  BUFFY
    What's it do?
  ANDREW
    I don't know. Something not good. It didn't work 'cause... there wasn't enough 
    blood. (turns to leave) OK. (Buffy stops him)
  DAWN
    (investigating the wheel they hung Spike from last episode) There's blood 
    on this. Lots. (turns to Buffy) Looks like the first made another sacrifice. 
    Or a music video.
  BUFFY
    The seal could've been activated. I bet that's what the First needed Spike 
    for. 
  ANDREW
    (panics) That wasn't there before. I had nothing to do with that.
  XANDER
    Thanks for clearing that up 'cause otherwise we might've thought you were 
    up to no good here at the satanic manhole cover. You killed your best friend!
  ANDREW
    (softly) He's in a place of joy and peace. He told me. (Buffy rolls her eyes)
  XANDER
    No, nobody told you. You got tricked by a fake ghost.
  BUFFY
    Boys, can we save the encounter session? We need to cover this thing up. (grabs 
    nearby shovels, hands them out) Whatever it does, we can't leave it exposed 
    like this.
  They start shoveling dirt over the seal.
  Cut to:
  17     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    After covering up the seal, Xander and Andrew walk out of the Seal of Danthazar 
    room and into the hallway, followed by Buffy and Dawn.
  ANDREW
    Man, this place gives me the creeps. It's like in Wonder Woman, issue 297/299—
  XANDER
    "Catacombs"—yeah with the skeletons.
  ANDREW & XANDER
    (simultaneously, smiling and nodding) That was cool.
  XANDER
    (suddenly frowns and pushes Andrew) Move it. This way.
  DAWN
    So what next? We found the seal, but no Spike. 
  BUFFY
    (sighs) I don't know. The first was camped underground last time I found him, 
    but—
  Principal Wood passes them in the basement hallway, carrying a shovel, 
    looking a little disheveled.
  PRINCIPAL
    Buffy?
  BUFFY
    (turns to face him) Hey.
  PRINCIPAL
    Hey. I—thought that you were, um—
  DAWN
    Sick? She was. Oh, vomiting and oozing from various places and—
  PRINCIPAL
    Yeah, I remember, so please don't go on.
  DAWN
    Oh, but now, it's amazing. The doctor gave her some cream.
  BUFFY
    (overlapping with Dawn) Pills. (Principal looks back and forth between them) 
    And a cream. And I'm all better. (stares at the Principal's shovel)
  PRINCIPAL
    Oh, yeah, um, apparently somebody left this in the courtyard, and I was just 
    returning it.
  BUFFY
    That's some full-service principaling.
  PRINCIPAL
    I try.
  BUFFY
    (looks at her own shovel) Oh, I was down here helping Dawn with a school project.
  DAWN
    For science. 
  BUFFY
    We buried a, um, uh, time capsule.
  DAWN
    Hello people of the future. Kids of today like Red Bull and, uh, Jackass. 
    (laughs nervously)
  BUFFY
    We better go. (Buffy and Dawn turn to leave)
  PRINCIPAL
    Buffy? (Buffy turns back to face him) You know if you are feeling better, 
    I could really use you back at work. I've been wait listing kids who really 
    want to see you.
  BUFFY
    Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, I'm sorry, you know, I was just—I've been ill and stuff.
  PRINCIPAL
    No, no, it's fine, and I understand. It's just things are starting to back 
    up.
  BUFFY
    Well I-I-I'll be there tomorrow. No problem. 100% ooze free.
  PRINCIPAL
    Good.
  BUFFY
    OK.
  Buffy and Dawn walk away one direction and Principal Wood walks away in 
    the other direction. Buffy turns to look at him quizzically, then turns back. 
    Then Principal Wood turns to look at Buffy, twirling his shovel as he walks 
    away.
  Cut to:
  18     INT.     DINING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Anya brings in a candle and sets it on the dining room table in front of Willow. 
    Willow strikes a match to light the various candles in front of her. Dawn's 
    at the other end of the table using Willow's laptop computer. Buffy and Xander 
    are standing at the end of the room, near the foyer, watching the goings on.
  XANDER
    (to Buffy) How's it going?
  BUFFY
    Dawn's trying to find out anything she can about the Seal of Danzalthar. Will's 
    about to do a locator spell, see if we can find The First. (yawns)
  XANDER
    Why don't you go get some rest. You haven't slept for like two days. We'll 
    call you if we find anything.
  BUFFY
    Nah, I-I couldn't sleep. Too much going on. 
  XANDER
    It'll be OK, Buff. We've faced this kind of stuff before.
  Willow pours a sandy mixture on the table in front of her.
  BUFFY
    You didn't see The First. I did. I felt it. It was like—
  A magical explosion sends Anya back against the wall in the corner. The 
    bowl in front of Willow glows red. Dawn shrieks and jumps back from the table, 
    crawling away to hide. The red light surrounds Willow then enters her body 
    through her nostrils. She throws her head back and a demonic apparition (huge, 
    with two horns on its head and glowy red eyes) escapes her mouth, lunging 
    toward Buffy. 
  BUFFY
    Will!
  The demon goes back inside Willow, and she stands, sending red lightning 
    bolts from her mouth. The bolts are aimed at Buffy, knocking her down and 
    sending her across the floor on her back into the foyer.
  WILLOW
    (in a deep possessed voice) You only make me stronger!
  Xander grabs the glowing bowl from the spell, and throws it against the 
    dining room wall, shattering it. The light disappears, and Willow collapses, 
    crying and twitching. Xander goes to check on Anya. Buffy kneels at Willow's 
    side, holding her head.
  BUFFY
    Will!
  WILLOW
    It's still in me. I feel it!
  BUFFY
    No, it's not. It's gone. You're OK.
  WILLOW
    I don't want to hurt anybody. Please, Buffy, don't let it make me. Oh, God!
  BUFFY
    We won't. I promise, OK? I promise. We won't use magic to fight this thing 
    until we know what we're doing.
  WILLOW
    I can't. I can't. I'm sorry.
  Cut to:
  19     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Willow's standing off to the side of the room. Anya and Dawn are sitting on 
    the couch. Buffy's got her coat on, ready to leave. Xander's discussing the 
    plan with her.
  XANDER
    At least let me come with you.
  BUFFY
    (walks to foyer) I'm going alone.
  XANDER
    You said yourself, you don't know how to fight The First, or even where it 
    is. 
  BUFFY
    (sighs) It's out there. It's hurting my friends. I'll find it. 
  Buffy opens the front door to leave, but sees Giles standing there on 
    her front porch when she opens it.
  GILES
    Buffy.
  BUFFY
    Giles. 
  Buffy goes to hug Giles, but is cut off when three girls she's never met 
    walk right into her house.
  GIRL #1
    (in a Cockney British accent) Nice place. Bit of a mess. (walks inside the 
    house)
  Girl #2 walks by Buffy and smiles, but says nothing.
  GIRL #3
    (looks at Buffy) This is a slayer? (looks away and sighs on her way inside 
    the house)
  Buffy stares at the girls, then looks at Giles, confused.
  GILES
    Sorry to barge in. We have a slight apocalypse.
  Fade to black.
  ACT II:
  20     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Dawn's standing in front of the three girls Giles brought with him. The three 
    girls are lined up against the wall, and Dawn's inspecting them, arms crossed 
    in front of her. 
  DAWN
    They're all slayers?
  GILES
    Potential slayers. Waiting for one to be called. There were many more like 
    them all over the world, but, um, now there's just a handful, and they're 
    all on their way to Sunnydale.
  BUFFY
    The others were murdered. 
   
    20a     EXT.     CITY 
      STREET IN ISTANBUL, TURKEY - NIGHT
      A dark-haired girl is held down by two hooded figures, and a third figure 
      raises an arched, shiny, silver dagger and thrusts down at her.
    20b     INT.     PARKING 
      GARAGE IN FRANKFURT, GERMANY - NIGHT
      A girl with hot pink hair with black bangs at her forehead, a nose ring, 
      and a metal collar is trying to escape her pursuers. Robed men close the 
      door behind them and start to fight with her. She is knocked to the ground, 
      lying on her back. Finally, one of the robed people pulls out a curved silver 
      dagger and stabs her.
  
  GILES
    In cold blood. As well as their watchers. We always feared that this day would 
    come, when there'd be an attack against not just an individual slayer, but 
    against the whole line.
  
    20c     INT.     FLAT 
      IN ENGLAND - DAY
      Giles enters the flat, looking around. He sees Robson lying injured on the 
      floor and goes to his side.
    ROBSON
      (eyes flash open) It's started.
  
  BUFFY
    The First. That's what it wants.
  GILES
    Yes, to erase all the slayers in training and their watchers along with their 
    methods.
  BUFFY
    And then Faith, and then me. And with all the potentials gone and no way of 
    making another, it's the end. No more slayer. Ever.
  WILLOW
    But we haven't found any information on The First. No documentation—
  GILES
    (crosses arms) That's because it predates any written history, and it rarely 
    shows its true face. The only record I know was in the Council Library.
  ANYA
    What about the Council? What do they say about this?
  GILES
    Gone. (looks at Buffy, who stares back in shock)
  WILLOW
    What?
  GILES
    Obliterated. They were in session, and, uh, there was an explosion.
  WILLOW
    That means all the Council's records are-are destroyed?
  GILES
    Annabelle. (Girl #2 unzips her book bag, takes two books and a stack of files 
    from it and lays them on the coffee table in front of Willow) That's what's 
    left. (Willow, Anya, Dawn and Buffy each take some of the new material and 
    peruse it) The mystic secrets of the Watchers. And whatever I could find on 
    The First. When I learned what was happening, I-I, um, I stole them.
  ANYA
    And you blew the Council up! See, this is what happens when you're all stuffy 
    and repressed. You overreact.
  GILES
    Not—I didn't. Must've been an agent of The First, after my little burglary 
    session. The knowledge contained in these files had to be protected, and there 
    wasn't time for-for bureaucracy or debate. The Council knows no other way.
  ANDREW
    (still tied to a chair, he lets out a melodramatic observation) And it cost 
    them their lives! (everyone turns and stares, he sits back) Go on.
  BUFFY
    (to Xander) Can we gag him? (Xander claps and goes to Andrew, putting duct 
    tape over his mouth) But what do these records say about The First?
  GILES
    Uh, very little. It can change form. Uh, it only appears in the guise of someone 
    who's passed away.
  WILLOW
    Our ghosts.
  GILES
    Also it's not corporeal. It can't touch or fight on it's own. It only works 
    through those it manipulates. And its followers, the Bringers.
  GIRL #3
    Those freaks in the black robes.
  GIRL #1
    Yeah, with the hoodies and the crazy alphabet eyes. I never saw 'em, I just 
    heard—
  ANNABELLE/GIRL #2
    Shh! Molly, Mr. Giles doesn't need us prattling on.
  GILES
    (sits on arm of couch) The First is unlike anything we've faced before. I 
    mean, there's evil and then there's the thing that created evil, the source.
  BUFFY
    And that's what this thing claims to be?
  GILES
    That's what it is. It has eternities to act, endless resources. (stands) How 
    to defeat it—I-I— (sighs) honestly I don't know. But we have to 
    find a way. If the slayer line is eliminated, then the hell mouth has no guardian. 
    The balance is destroyed. (walks up to Buffy) I'm afraid it falls to you, 
    Buffy. Sorry. I mean, we'll do what we can, but you're the only one who has 
    the strength to protect these girls—and the world—against what's 
    coming.
  XANDER
    But no pressure.
  GIRL #3
    (walks to the center of the room, addressing everyone) That's it? That's the 
    plan? I don't see how one person, even a slayer, could protect us. I saw what 
    those bringer guys can do. They tore apart my watcher.
  GILES
    Of course we'll use all our resources—
  GIRL #3
    And if this thing is the root of all evil, isn't the hell mouth it's number 
    one vacation spot? I mean, don't you think we should be hiding our asses on 
    the other side of the globe?
  ANNABELLE
    Kennedy!
  BUFFY
    No, she's not wrong. We need more muscle. That's why we need to find Spike. 
  
  ANYA
    Yeah, he'll help. You know, if he's not crazy or off killing people or dead. 
    Or, you know, all of the above.

    CAVE - DAY
    Spike's head is thrust underwater, and he struggles under the force of hands 
    that are holding him down. Pan out to show that it's the UberVamp holding 
    Spike's head in a pool of water in the cave. Drusilla/First is pacing behind 
    them, supervising. Finally, Spike stops struggling, and the UberVamp pulls 
    Spike's head out of the pool and throws him on the ground. 
  DRUSILLA/FIRST
    That's why our kind make such good dollies.
  Lying face up on the ground, Spike coughs out water. He looks away from 
    Drusilla/First.  
  DRUSILLA/FIRST
    Hard to kill. Tried to enlighten little Buffy, didn't you? Spilled, spilled, 
    spilled our secrets like seed. (reaches down to touch her dress at thigh level, 
    slowly starts pulling up her skirt) But you forgot, I say what you tell and 
    what you know. I say when this is over. (lets go of her skirt and puts her 
    hands behind her head) And I'm not done with you yet. Not nearly. (clicks 
    tongue)
  On Drusilla/First's command, the UberVamp picks up Spike and heads for 
    the pool, forcing his head underwater again.

    Zoom in on a holiday display in a storefront window. Pan over to Buffy and 
    Giles walking side by side down the street.
  GILES
    This place you originally saw The First—you say it was in a Christmas 
    tree lot?
  BUFFY
    Under it. There was a hidden cavern. Just happened to be under a tree lot. 
    The Bringers were doing some kind of ritual. (looks at Giles) Giles, this 
    is bad, isn't it? A new kind of bad.
  GILES
    Just in time for Christmas.
  BUFFY
    (sighs, looks around) You know, I didn't even realize it was December. Maybe 
    when we get home, we should decorate the rubble. (looks at Giles) Think you'll 
    ever show up for a real visit? The kind where the world isn't about to end?
  GILES
    If we survive this, I promise.
  BUFFY
    Good. 'Cause I miss you.

    I miss you too.

    Andrew is still tied to the chair, talking to Xander.
  ANDREW
    So, how long have you followed Buffy?
  XANDER
    I don't follow her. She's my best friend.
  ANDREW
    Huh. She seems like a good leader. Her hair is shiny. Does she make you stab 
    things?
  Willow, who's putting a pillow and blanket on the couch, is talking to 
    Kennedy. She grabs a stack of bed sheets and starts walking toward the staircase. 
    
  WILLOW
    OK, so Annabelle can sleep down here, uh, Molly can sleep in Dawn's room—
  KENNEDY
    Not if Dawn actually wants to sleep. Molly'll talk her ear off.
  WILLOW
    OK, then Molly down here, you with Dawn, and Annabelle in my room. 
  KENNEDY
    Bad idea. Annabelle snores. 
  WILLOW
    (hands sheets to Kennedy) You wanna do the sleeping arrangements?
  KENNEDY
    (starts up the stairs) OK. (turns to face Willow) You, uh, better not hog 
    the covers. (smiles, turns to go upstairs)
  Willow eyes widen.
  DAWN
    (walks up to Willow from the kitchen) Does she want to eat?
  WILLOW
    What? Huh? Oh, she's—Oh, she's new. (glances up the stairs after Kennedy)
  DAWN
    (walks back to the kitchen, Willow follows) Well, Annabelle and Molly are 
    starved and I totally burnt the mac and cheese. Oh, um, I'll put hot sauce 
    on it, tell 'em it's an American thing, say it's blackened.

    Anya is scraping the burnt mac and cheese out of the pot and into the garbage

  ANYA
    Actually, it's not blackened so much as ruined.
  WILLOW
    Or we can order pizza.
  ANNABELLE
    (sitting at the island, reading a book) As long as it's plain. I'm veggie.
  MOLLY

  ANNABELLE
    Just because you'll eat any kind of trash—
  MOLLY
    (finds boxes of cookies on the counter) Brill! Biscuits! You don't mind do 
    you? I got a case of the nerves after Mr. Giles lecture.
  DAWN
    (opens a box of cookies) Knock yourself out. I feel a cookie problem coming

  25     EXT.     CHRISTMAS 
    TREE SALES LOT - NIGHT
    Buffy and Giles walk into the empty Christmas tree lot. Lights are strung, 
    but there are no trees there. The two of them are looking around. 
  GILES
    So the entrance to the cave was above ground here?
  BUFFY
    Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was around here somewhere.
  GILES
    Well, we'll just keep—
  BUFFY (O.S.)
    (crunch of breaking wood can be heard) Aah! (Giles turns to look) Found it!
  Buffy has fallen into a hole in the ground that was covered with wooden 
    slats that apparently gave way. Giles puts his glasses on and bends to look 
    into the hole.
  GILES
    Good lord, are you all right?
  Cut to:
  26     INT.     UNDERGROUND 
    CAVE - NIGHT
    Buffy has fallen into a cave and landed on top of some rubble. She stands 
    and dusts herself off while talking to Giles, who is still above ground.
  BUFFY
    Peachy, except my knees bend backwards now. OK, Giles, stay up there. I'm 
    gonna check it out.
  Buffy walks off further into the cave.
  GILES
    Right. (stands and looks around the empty lot above ground)
  Buffy walks around among the various cave formations. She looks up, she 
    looks down, and then something passes behind Buffy, unseen by her. She turns 
    to look, but no one is behind her. When she turns back, the UberVamp hisses 
    in her face. Buffy is startled, and the UberVamp takes that opportunity to 
    punch her so hard she flies across the room, landing against the wall and 
    falling to the ground. He kicks and punches her with such force that her blocks 
    are mostly ineffective. 
  She retreats, but he follows. Finally she gets some good offensive moves 
    in, but he's able to avoid or block more than half of them. He punches her 
    again, sending her rolling into another room. She gets to her feet before 
    the UberVamp can get to her and readies herself with a stake. When he finally 
    comes close enough, she stakes him right through the heart. He looks at the 
    stake, growls, looks at Buffy, and takes out the stake. Buffy's eyes grow 
    wide as she stares in utter shock.
  Fade to black.
  ACT III:
  27     INT.     UNDERGROUND 
    CAVE - NIGHT
    Resume. Buffy's staring at the UberVamp. 
  The UberVamp punches Buffy and comes after her with her own stake. Buffy 
    avoids his attacks, but her back's literally against the wall. Her eyes are 
    still wide as she watches him come after her. He punches her in the stomach 
    and throws her against the wall. She throws a punch at him, but he catches 
    her fist in his palm and squeezes until it makes crunching sounds, then twists 
    her arm, then pulls her body by the arm until he slams her head into a stalagmite, 
    before finally grabbing her throat, squeezing, and lifting her off the ground. 
    Buffy winces and looks around desperately until she finds a stalactite. She 
    breaks the stalactite off of the cave ceiling and bashes the UberVamp's head 
    with it. He drops her and falls to the ground. 
  While he's recovering, Buffy makes a run for it. She climbs the cave walls 
    toward the hole where she fell in. She's almost out, her hands are on the 
    Christmas tree lot ground, when the UberVamp grabs her heel. Buffy struggles 
    against him, trying to get out of the hole, but the UberVamp pulls her back 
    in. There's nothing on the ground for her to grab on to to resist. She kicks 
    the UberVamp in the head and tries again to crawl out of the hole. She barely 
    gets out of the hole and looks up at Giles, who is backlit by the rising sun, 
    which he blocks. The UberVamp starts to crawl out of the hole, but sees the 
    sunlight, and retreats back into it.

    Buffy and Giles walk into the kitchen through the back door, only to see the 
    three slayers in training already up and eating breakfast. 
  BUFFY
    (to Giles)...the others just yet. It'll give us a chance to— (sees the 
    girls in the kitchen)
  KENNEDY
    (eating a bowl of cereal) Sorry about the British invasion. 
  MOLLY
    (preparing toast and jelly) We've been up for hours.
  ANNABELLE
    (drinking from a mug) 4 P.M. London time. 
  KENNEDY
    Are you all right? You look...
  BUFFY
    (shuts the door) Oh. Yeah, I'm OK. I just got into a fight is all. (to Giles) 
    You want to tell me with what? (takes off her coat) 
  GILES
    Yes, Buffy, but don't you think we should, uh, discuss this privately?
  BUFFY
    You mean, not in front of the next generation? No time to coddle them, Giles. 
    Welcome to the war room, guys.
  Annabelle gets out a notepad to take notes.
  GILES
    Uh, what you fought was a vampire, but it was, um, something more than that. 
    It was a Turok-Han. As Neanderthals are to human beings, the Turok-Han are 
    to vampires. Primordial, ferociously powerful killing machines, as single-minded 
    as animals. They are the vampires that vampires fear. An ancient and entirely 
    different race and, until this morning, I thought they were a myth.
  BUFFY
    So, The First shows up, and now this? You think it's a coincidence?
  GILES
    I think it's more likely that the Turok-Han is here as an agent of The First.
  ANNABELLE
    Um, did you slay it?
  BUFFY
    No, it's still out there, somewhere.
  MOLLY
    What's it want?
  BUFFY
    All of us dead. But for now it looks like sunlight is keeping this UberVamp 
    away. 
  GILES
    So, until sunset, I suggest you get some rest. A few hours sleep will do a 
    world of difference.
  BUFFY
    No sleep today. Can't. 
  GILES
    Oh, come on, you're exhausted.
  BUFFY
    Ah, it comes with the gig. Somehow I don't think taking on prehistoric evil 
    comes with nap time. Sorry, potential guys. I know you came a long way, and 
    you wanna get into it, but the best thing you can do right now is just sit 
    tight, wait it out. I'm gonna go to work, see what I can find out. I'll be 
    back before sunset.
  GILES
    How do you plan to research something as ill-defined as The First?
  BUFFY
    I have the best plan ever.

    a search engine. In the search field, she has typed "evil".
  BUFFY
    (to phone) Yeah, well, I already re-checked the basement. (beat) Wait, you 
    know, hold on, I'm gonna try something. (types, sighs) Maybe The First isn't 
    ready for modern technology. Displaying results 1 through 10 of 900,517. OK, 
    I gotta narrow this down. I'll call you back? Yeah. (Buffy hangs up then types)
  PRINCIPAL
    (walks up to her cubicle wall without her noticing, reading from her computer 
    screen) Manifestations of evil? (Buffy types more in the search field, Principal 
    reads what she's typing) In... the... movies. (to Buffy) You're searching 
    for evil movies?
  BUFFY
    Uh, I know it's not the all-time most kosher use of my office hours, um, but, 
    you know, looking at some down time. And what can I say, I just love those 
    evil, evil movies. Like Exorcist, you know, Blair Witch...
  PRINCIPAL
    Hmm. As opposed to Rob Schneider's Oeuvre.
  BUFFY
    Different kind of evil.
  PRINCIPAL
    Yeah. (walks into her cubicle) Buffy, you know, I'm not that big a fan of 
    scary movies, even the hokie ones. Sometimes they go to a place that I think 
    kids could stand to avoid. (sits in the chair in front of her desk, crosses 
    his arms and leans forward on her desk)
  BUFFY
    Well, it's not for the kids.
  PRINCIPAL
    (looking her right in the eyes) Yeah, yeah, I'm only saying that once you 
    see true evil, it can have some serious after burn, and then you can't unsee 
    what you saw. Ever. That's just one opinion. I better get back to work. (stands 
    and walks out of her cubicle)
  BUFFY
    (calls after him) What kind of movies do you like?

    Never learned his headmaster's lesson while all the school bells ring (mimes 
    ringing a bell) and ring and ring and ring and ring...(bends down to whisper 
    in his ear) Choose a side. Choose our side. You know that it's delicious.

    (turns to Annabelle) Hey, you know what would help with that? (turns to Buffy) 
    Weapons. 
  BUFFY
    Uh, I don't know about that—
  KENNEDY
    We're sitting ducks without them.
  ANNABELLE
    We're with the slayer. Safe as houses.
  KENNEDY
    (to Annabelle) Do you see the house we're in?
  ANNABELLE
    It'll come straight for us, won't it?
  BUFFY
    We should load them up, Giles.

    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Andrew is still tied to a chair. Xander walks into the dining room.
  ANDREW
    Listen to me, man, I've got a bad feeling about this.
  XANDER
    Of course you've got a bad feeling, dude. You're-you're tied to a chair.
  ANDREW
    No. Yeah, but above and beyond that. I'm telling you that my spider-sense 
    is tingling. This is gonna get hairy. I'm talking weird with a beard. Better 
    untie me.
  BUFFY
    And that'll help us, how? 
  ANDREW
    (sighs) OK, I know what you're thinking. Andrew, bad guy. You think I'm a 
    super-villain like Dr. Doom or Apocalypse or-or The Riddler. But I admit I 
    went over to the dark side, but just to pick up a few things, a-and now I'm 
    back. I've learned. I'm good again.
  BUFFY
    And when were you good before? (Buffy and Xander walk out)
  ANDREW
    OK, technically, never. Touché. (struggles against his restraints) 
    But I'm like Vader in the last 5 minutes of Jedi with redemptive powers minus 
    a redemptive struggle of epic redemption which chronicles... (stops struggling 
    and sighs) These ropes itch.

    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Buffy's looking out the window, and she turns to speak to Giles as he walks 
    up to her.
  BUFFY
    How're we doing on time?
  GILES
    Sunset should be any minute now. Done everything we can. And don't worry, 
    everyone here understands that you're calling the shots. 
  BUFFY
    I just hope I'm calling the right ones.
  GILES
    You have all my faith. And they're depending on you.
  BUFFY
    Giles, that's not exactly what I needed to hear right now.
  MOLLY
    (enters the room, interrupts them) Guys? Annabelle split.

    IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT
    Annabelle is running down the street, looking over her shoulder. She's run 
    into an industrial manufacturing complex, and as she runs past a dumpster, 
    the UberVamp jumps out and grabs her by the throat, growling and lifting her 
    off the ground. Cut to a shot of her cross pendant necklace falling to the 
    ground.
  Fade to black.
  ACT IV:
  38     EXT.     STREET 
    IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT
    Buffy has found her way to the same industrial manufacturing complex where 
    Annabelle was last seen being attacked by the UberVamp. She walks past the 
    dumpster and sees Annabelle's body lying still on the ground. 
  Buffy is visibly upset, taking a moment to contemplate the situation, 
    when the UberVamp attacks her from behind, knocking her to the ground. Buffy 
    crawls away to crouch beside the dumpster. She looks at the UberVamp and then 
    gets up to fight with it. She kicks, he ducks. She punches, he blocks. He 
    punches her in the face, then in the stomach, and Buffy falls to the ground 
    face first. He picks her up and tries to choke her, but she spits blood in 
    his face, startling him, and Buffy manages to escape his clutches. She runs 
    away, hiding in the nearby factory. The UberVamp licks the blood off of his 
    face, growls, and heads after Buffy. 
  Cut to:
  39     INT.     FACTORY 
    IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT
    Buffy runs into the factory and looks around for somewhere to hide.
  She's not making a fast flight since she's limping. She goes deeper into 
    the building, which is very industrial in nature with many vertical metal 
    pipes and valves. The UberVamp has followed her to the building and is looking 
    for her. She surprises it by coming from behind it and smacking it in the 
    head with a large metal pipe, but she doesn't even manage to knock him down. 
    They fight and he wrestles the pipe from her hand when she swings it at him 
    again. He throws the pipe to the ground and they return to martial arts. 
  He punches her and she bends over at the waist. He kicks her in the chest, 
    sending her crashing into a metal support beam. He comes at her again, and 
    she drops to the ground to avoid his fist. She stands, and he punches and 
    kicks her, finally causing her to double over in pain as he punches her ribs. 
    He punches her in the head, sending her to the ground again. He picks her 
    up, backhands her in the face, then punches her so hard, she flies 25 feet 
    across the room. 
  He runs toward her, but she looks around and notices a pulley hoisting 
    a pallet of metal beams. Buffy kicks a control lever for the pulley, sending 
    the beams crashing on top of the UberVamp as he comes towards her. Still lying 
    on the ground, Buffy hides her face as they land. She gets up and runs away 
    slowly, still limping, but stops and turns around. Her eyes widen as she sees 
    the UberVamp rising from the pile of metal beams, unhurt. He leaps out of 
    the rubble and sprints after her. 
  In no time at all, he has caught up to her, grabbing her from behind and 
    throwing her into a concrete wall. She steps back, still standing, as the 
    UberVamp literally crawls up the wall to gain momentum and height to kick 
    her in the face, knocking Buffy to the ground. Then he kicks her in the head 
    again before grabbing her arm and throwing Buffy through a concrete block 
    wall. The wall crumbles down on top of her, the roof caves in, and there's 
    blackness.
  Cut to:
  40     INT.     FACTORY 
    IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT
    In the blackness, Xander's voice can be heard.
  XANDER
    Buffy!
  He lifts off part of the metal roof that has fallen on top of Buffy, revealing 
    her body lying there still on the ground in a pile of rubble, her face covered 
    in blood. Xander is flanked by Willow and Giles.
  XANDER
    Oh, God almighty.
  They all stare at Buffy's beaten body.

  41     INT.     UNDERGROUND 
    CAVE - NIGHT
    A frowning Drusilla/First is talking to Spike, who's lying face up on a rock.
  DRUSILLA/FIRST
    Do you know why you're alive?
  SPIKE
    (weakly) Never figured you for existential thought, luv. I mean, you hated 
    Paris.
  DRUSILLA/FIRST
    You're alive for one reason, and one reason only. Because I wish it. Do you 
    know why I wish it? (holds her hands to her heart) Because I'm not done with 
    you.
  SPIKE
    (scoffs) Give it up. (Drusilla/First rolls her eyes and turns away) Whatever 
    you are, whatever you get away with, I'm out. You can't pull this puppet's 
    strings anymore.
  DRUSILLA/FIRST
    (snaps back to face Spike) And what makes you think you have a choice? What 
    makes you think you will ever be any good at all in this world?
  SPIKE
    She does. Because she believes in me.

  42     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    HOUSE - NIGHT
    Buffy's curled up in fetal position in a chair in an empty room, listening 
    to the others talk in the next room. She's beaten up quite badly, her face 
    bloody and bruised. She stares straight ahead as she listens.
  GILES (O.S.)
    We could make plans as we always do, but the truth is, Buffy was our plan. 
    There is no back up.
  WILLOW (O.S.)
    Giles, she looks bad.
  GILES (O.S.)
    She does. I'm afraid there may be internal bleeding.
  WILLOW (O.S.)
    What does that mean? Will she—
  GILES (O.S.)
    Die? I don't think so. I don't know.
  WILLOW (O.S.)
    What do we do if she can't fight, if she can't beat this thing?
  Cut to:
  43     INT.     DINING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Giles is pacing, talking. The slayers in training are sitting around the dining 
    room table, along with Dawn and Anya. Xander and Willow are leaning against 
    the wall.
  GILES
    We're back at square one.
  XANDER
    Which square would that be, exactly?
  GILES
    I'm not sure. The First predates everything we've ever known, or can know. 
    It's everywhere. It's pure. I don't know if we can fight it.
  Buffy walks in, and everyone turns to look, seemingly unaware that she'd 
    been listening.
  BUFFY
    (solemn) You're right. We don't know how to fight it. We don't know when it'll 
    come. We can't run, can't hide, can't pretend it's not the end, 'cause it 
    is. Something's always been there to try and destroy the world. We've beaten 
    them back, but we're not dealing with them anymore. We're dealing with the 
    reason they exist. Evil. The strongest. The First. 
  GILES
    Buffy, I—I-I know you're tired.
  BUFFY
    (resolute) I'm beyond tired. I'm beyond scared. I'm standing on the mouth 
    of hell, and it is gonna swallow me whole. And it'll choke on me. We're not 
    ready? They're not ready. They think we're gonna wait for the end to come, 
    like we always do. I'm done waiting. They want an apocalypse? Oh, we'll give 
    'em one. Anyone else who wants to run, do it now. 'Cause we just became an 
    army. We just declared war. From now on, we won't just face our worst fears, 
    we will seek them out. We will find them, and cut out their hearts one by 
    one, until The First shows itself for what it really is. And I'll kill it 
    myself. There is only one thing on this earth more powerful than evil, and 
    that's us. Any questions?
