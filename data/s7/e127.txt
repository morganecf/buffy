  1      INT.    BRONZE NIGHTCLUB 
    - NIGHT
    There's a troll talking to Anya, and he seems to know her from the past.
  TROLL
  You seem determined to put an end to all my fun. Just like you always did when 
  we were dating!
BUFFY
  You dated a troll?
ANYA
  Well, he wasn't a troll then. You know, he was just a big dumb guy.

  Where is everyone?
ANYA
  At the new high school. Buffy's got some kind of job there, Spike's insane in 
  the basement.

    Buffy, Xander and Spike are there with Nancy, trying to find out why a worm

ANYA
  (laughs) Yes.

  WILLOW
    I got the impression that you enjoyed—inflicting.
ANYA

  Didn't use to be.

    Anya and Halfrek are talking over coffee.
  HALFREK
    It's the talk of the order. They're calling you "Miss Softserve." 
  
ANYA
  Excuse me?
  HALFREK
  No deaths. No eviscerations. You're not goading women into anything inventive, 
  and you're not delivering when it is.
ANYA
  It was a glitch, and I am so back in the vengeance fold.
  Fade to black.
  End Recap.

The Start Of Episode
  Prologue:
  8      INT.    BUFFY'S OLD 
    BEDROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Dawn is helping Willow unpack her things. She's moving in to Buffy's old room. 
    
  DAWN
    My advice to you is do exactly what everyone else does all the time. 
WILLOW
  Got it. 
  DAWN
  Do what everyone else does, wear what everyone else wears, say what everyone 
  else says.
WILLOW
  OK.
  DAWN
    People may say something to you you don't understand. Just don't be afraid 
    to keep your mouth shut and pretend like you know what they're saying.
WILLOW
  (laughs) You know, Dawn, I've been to college before.
  DAWN
  People may say something like "My protein window closes in an hour." 
  Just nod and smile. Mm-hmm. Turns out it has something to do with fitness.
  Buffy and Xander enter the room, carrying boxes.
BUFFY
  Have you talked to her lately?
XANDER
  Not since that night with the Gnarl demon. And that wasn't exactly the kind 
  of "how have you been" kind of talk. More of the "pierce its 
  eye with something sharp" kind of talking. I'm thinking I should call her.
BUFFY
  I just don't want you to get your hopes up.
XANDER
  Hopes? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. There are no hopes. Anya and I are done. I love 
  being single. I'm a strong, successful male who is giddy at the thought of all 
  the women I will no doubt be dating in the near future.
BUFFY
  Strong, successful males say "giddy"?
XANDER
  I just worry about her, that's all.
WILLOW
  Anya?
XANDER
  Yeah, she seems so sad.
  DAWN
  She should try acting like everybody else more.
WILLOW
  Apparently it's what all the kids are doing nowadays.
BUFFY
  Well, I'm not sure I get the sad vibe, but there's definitely a vengeance vibe 
  worth worrying about. 
XANDER
  Oh, that? No, no. I don't worry about that. She was hurt and she just turned 
  back to what she knew when I— you know. But that's not her anymore.
BUFFY
  I hope you're right.
XANDER
    Well, she turned that worm guy back before any real damage happened, right? 
    It'll just take some time. I really think she's coming around.  Cut to:
  9      INT.    FRAT HOUSE 
    AT U.C. SUNNYDALE - NIGHT
    A boy is dead on the ground. Pan around to show several boys have been killed, 
    their hearts ripped out of their bodies. The place is full of dead boys. Show 
    Anya sitting in shock, looking around at the mayhem, smeared with blood.
ANYA
  What have I done?

  ACT I:
  10      INT.    RUSTIC MEDIEVAL 
    HOUSE - DAY
    A long-haired brunette Anya is holding a cute brown bunny. Olaf walks in and 
    starts talking to her in swedish language (dialogue shown below is subtitled). 
    He's wearing leather and animal skins. Anya is in a dress.
  TITLE CARD: Sjornjost, 880.
  OLAF
    Aud! Sweet, beautiful Aud! I am so hungry, I could eat a small child!
ANYA
  Olaf! Are you injured? You smell of blood and musk. 
OLAF
  Fear not! It takes more than a band of minor trolls to bring down the mighty 
  Olaf!
ANYA
  Trolls!
OLAF
  Oh! They are wretched creatures indeed. The mere thought of them makes me bend 
  at the knee and flex! (does a muscleman pose)
ANYA
  Sweetheart, please sit down. Allow me to tend to you.
OLAF
  I am fine. Really. I could go for some mead, though.
ANYA
  Certainly.
OLAF
    (looking around the room) Is it my imagination, or do we have substantially 
    more rabbits in this house today?
ANYA
  Oh, they breed so quickly that it's—
OLAF
  All this talk of breeding... it makes me want to breed!
ANYA
  Honey, of course. But here—drink your mead first.
OLAF
  Ah, yes. Mead.
ANYA
  The rapid reproductive rate of our rabbits...has given me an idea. I can give 
  the excess out to the townspeople, exchanging them not for goods or services, 
  but for goodwill and the sense of accomplishment that stems from selflessly 
  giving of yourself to others.
OLAF
  Ha, ha, ha! Sweet Aud! Your logic is insane and happenstance, like that of a 
  troll. It is no wonder that the bar matrons talk of you. 
ANYA
  You've been to the bar...
OLAF
  (sighs) It is not my fault they don't take kindly to you. You speak your mind, 
  and are annoying. It's one of the things I love most about you.
ANYA
  Was Rannveig there?
OLAF
  Bah! I've told you a thousand times; I have no interest in this Rannveig. Her 
  hips are large and load bearing, like a Baltic woman. Your hips are narrow, 
  like a Baltic woman from a slightly more arid region. You are my perfect Aud. 
  I could never want for another.
ANYA
  I am sorry. I simply love you so much...I feel as though I could burst at times...I 
  could not live without you.
OLAF
  Fear not, sweet Aud, you will always be my beautiful girl.
  Cut to:
  11      INT.    FRAT HOUSE 
    AT U.C. SUNNYDALE - NIGHT
    Blood-soaked hands are washing up at a porcelain sink. The water runs red. 
    Anya looks up from her washing and can barely face herself in the mirror.
  Cut to:
  12      INT.    BASEMENT 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Spike is sitting on the floor with his back to a chain link fence that's separating 
    one area from another. He seems rather substantially more coherent and mentally 
    stable than he's seemed recently, and definitely more sound than he's ever 
    seemed in the basement.
  SPIKE
  I don't trust what I see anymore. I don't know how to explain it, exactly. It's 
  like I've been seeing things. (pan over to show he's talking to Buffy) Dru used 
  to see things, you know? She'd always be staring up at the sky watching cherubs 
  burn or the heavens bleed or some nonsense. I used to stare at her and think 
  she'd gone completely sack of hammers. But she'd see the sky when we were inside 
  and it'd make her so happy. She'd see showers. She'd see stars. Now I see her.
  Buffy's wearing a white shirt and an open, non-judgmental face.
BUFFY
  (compassionate and patient) Spike.
  SPIKE
  I'm in trouble, Buffy.
BUFFY
  I can help you.
  SPIKE
  I could never ask. Not after...
BUFFY
  It's different. You're different.
  SPIKE
  I could never ask.
BUFFY
  Spike, it's me. It's you and it's me, and we'll get through this.
  SPIKE
  Never...
  Spike's nervously got his hand behind his ear, and Buffy reached to hold 
    his hand.
BUFFY
  We'll get through this. 
  Pan over to show someone is coming. It's Buffy, wearing a black shirt and 
    a scowl. Spike is still sitting huddled on the floor. Alone. He seems crazy 
    again now.
BUFFY
    Spike. (he looks up, surprised) This basement is killing you. This is the 
    hellmouth. There is something bad down here, possibly everything bad.
  SPIKE
  (laughs) Can't hear you. Can't hear you. 
BUFFY
  You have a soul? Fine. Show me.
  SPIKE
  Scream montresor all you like, pet.
BUFFY
  Get up and get out of this basement.
  SPIKE
  I don't have anywhere else to go.
  Cut to:
  13     EXT.    U.C. SUNNYDALE 
    CAMPUS - DAY
    Willow is talking to her professor.
WILLOW
  And it's not like I've been gone for that long, and I've already done all the 
  reading that I missed. And I can sign up for—
  PROFESSOR
  Willow, Willow, it's OK. We'll get you caught up in no time.
WILLOW
  (smiles) Really?
  PROFESSOR
  What am I gonna say? No, I don't want my best student back in my class? Well, 
  of course I noticed that drop-off in your grades at mid-term last year, and 
  I was concerned—
WILLOW
  Yeah, that was—
  PROFESSOR
  But then—viola. You turned it around and aced all your finals like—boom. Magic.
WILLOW
  (nervous laugh) Yeah, similar to, but, um...
  PROFESSOR
  Look, come see me during office hours tomorrow and we'll see about what we need 
  to do to get you caught up, all right?
WILLOW
  OK. Thanks, professor. (professor leaves, Willow spots Anya and waves) Anya! 
  Anya!
  Anya is wearing a raincoat pulled tightly over her dress to hide the bloodstains 
    as she walks out of the fraternity house into the populated campus. Willow 
    is happy to see a friend, but Anya is nervous and distracted. 
ANYA
  Willow, hi! What're you doing here?
WILLOW
  Oh, I'm starting back up at school again! Yeah, I can't believe how great everyone's 
  been. I-I was a little worried, but I already have books and homework and they 
  even said they'd give me periodic surprise quizzes just to make up for the ones 
  that I missed, and... Wh-what're you doing here? (confused) Walking out of the 
  fraternity house in the middle of the day?
ANYA
  Uh, um... I have a new boyfriend now. He lives here.
WILLOW
  That's great.
ANYA
  (avoiding eye contact) Yeah, we just had lots and lots of sex.
WILLOW
  OK. This is so great. I am so happy to see you've— (Anya nervously pushes a 
  strand of hair behind her ear, and Willow sees blood on her hand) moved on.
ANYA
  Yeah, we're tremendously happy together. Now, um, if you'll excuse me, I'm late 
  for something important. 
WILLOW
  Uh, OK. See you later.
  Willow goes to the fraternity house to check it out.
  Cut to:
  14      INT.    FRAT HOUSE 
    AT U.C. SUNNYDALE - NIGHT
    Willow walks into the house through huge glass paned wooden double-doors. 
    It's the Gamma Kappa Tau house.
WILLOW
  Hello? Is anybo—
  She looks down and sees huge bloodstains and smudges on the floor. Looking 
    around, the house is eerily empty. She walks in further to investigate, and 
    there are blood stains everywhere, on the walls, door, and floor. When she 
    opens the door to an adjacent room, what she sees horrifies her. She hears 
    a high-pitched whimper from another room, and goes to investigate. It's coming 
    from a closet. Willow opens it to see a young woman in there crying and rocking 
    in fetal position. She also has blood on her clothes. 
  YOUNG WOMAN
  (crying) I take it back. I take it back. I take it back.
WILLOW
  (bends down to talk to her) It's OK. You're OK. 
  YOUNG WOMAN
  (crying) I take it back.
WILLOW
  W-what do you take back?
  YOUNG WOMAN
  (crying) 'S gonna be a party. Everyone's gonna be there. Everyone's bringing 
  a date. I'll have a great time. But it was just me. And them. He broke up with 
  me in front of them. I was a game. It was all a game.
WILLOW
  It's OK. You're OK now.
  YOUNG WOMAN
  They laughed and they laughed and I cried and they laughed. And I yelled, "Just 
  once, I wish you could all feel what it's like to have your hearts ripped out. 
  Just once. I wish..." (sobs) and it came. 
WILLOW
  (stands) OK. Come on, what came? What did this?
  YOUNG WOMAN
  A spider.
WILLOW
  W-where did it go?
  YOUNG WOMAN
  What do you mean?
WILLOW
  The spider. Where is it now?
  As Willow talks, we see a huge (~5 foot long) spider crawling up the wall 
    behind her. 
  Fade to black.
  ACT II:
  15      INT.    FRAT HOUSE 
    AT U.C. SUNNYDALE - NIGHT
    Resume. Willow is talking to the Young Woman. The spider is on the wall behind 
    Willow. It lunges at her, and she puts her hand up for a spell.
WILLOW
  Protect!
  A shield of yellow light protects Willow and the Young Woman from the spider 
    attack. Frightened, the Young Woman starts crying again. Willow, black-eyed, 
    snaps back at the Young Woman.
WILLOW
  For God's sake, shut your whimpering mouth!
  The spider is trying to get through the protective barrier, and Willow magically 
    thrusts it out through a nearby window.
WILLOW
  I'm sorry. 
  Cut to:
  16     EXT.     SJORNJOST 
    MEDIEVAL VILLAGE - DAY
    Villagers are fleeing in a mob.
  VILLAGE MAN
  Troll!
  VILLAGE WOMAN
  It's the largest troll I've ever seen!
  VILLAGE MAN
  Run! Hide your babies and your beadwork!
  TROLL
  Stop!
  It's Olaf (with his hammer). He's got horns and green skin now, and so no 
    one recognizes him.
  TROLL
  Stop! It is Olaf!
  VILLAGE MAN
  The troll is doing an Olaf impersonation!
  TROLL
  I am Olaf!
  VILLAGE MAN
  Hit him with fruits and various meats.
  TROLL
  Aaarrrrgh!
  TROLL
  I am Olaf!
  The villagers chase him out of town while Anya watches. D'Hoffryn steps 
    up beside her.
D'HOFFRYN
  Impressive. 
ANYA
  Thank you.
D'HOFFRYN
    What is that? A Woodlow Transmogriphic spell?
ANYA
  Thornton's Hope.
D'HOFFRYN
  Thornton's Hope. But how did you get the troll element?
ANYA
  Eelsbane.
D'HOFFRYN
  Eelsbane. Brilliant! What'd he do?
ANYA
  Bar matron. A load bearing bar matron.
D'HOFFRYN
  Is there any other kind. (Anya starts to walk off) I'm sorry. How rude of me. 
  Allow me to introduce myself. My name is D'Hoffryn.
ANYA
  I am Aud.
D'HOFFRYN
  Are you? Hmm. I'm afraid you don't see your true self. You are Anyanka. I'm 
  a patron of a family of sorts. We're vengeance demons. I'm sure you've heard 
  of us.
ANYA
  No, I'm sorry.
D'HOFFRYN
  Oh, well, that's quite—
ANYA
  Oh, no, don't feel bad. I, uh, I don't talk to people much. I mean, I talk to 
  them, but they don't talk to me. Except to say that your questions are irksome, 
  and perhaps you should take your furs and your literal interpretations to the 
  other side of the river.

    Olaf is chasing the mob now.
OLAF
  Come here tiny man. You are small and toy like.

  18     EXT.     SJORNJOST 
    MEDIEVAL VILLAGE - DAY
    Resume. Anya and D'Hoffryn are talking.
D'HOFFRYN
  I get the sense that your talents are not fully appreciated here, Anyanka. We'd 
  like you to join us.
ANYA
  Why do you keep calling me that? My name is Aud.
D'HOFFRYN
  Perhaps, but Anyanka is who you are.
ANYA
  What would I have to do?
D'HOFFRYN
    What you do best. Help wronged women punish evil men.
ANYA
  Vengeance.
D'HOFFRYN
  But only to those who deserve it.
ANYA
  They all deserve it.
D'HOFFRYN
  That's where I was going with that, yeah.
  Cut to: 
  19      INT.    BUFFY'S CUBICLE 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Buffy's at her desk, wearing the same black shirt she wore in the basement. 
    Buffy is clearly bored, as evidenced by her balancing a pencil holder full 
    of pencils on her forehead. The phone rings and breaks her conversation, causing 
    her to jump and spill the pencils. She answers the phone.
BUFFY
  Hello. Willow, hey! Is everything— A spider demon? Wh— h-hold on. A-are you 
  all right? Like how? (grabs paper to write something down) Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Wait, 
  OK, go ahead. No, no, no, no, no. It's all good. I'll get Xander to go. But 
  seriously, you just— Whoa. Ripped out the heart? My God. Hey, did you get that 
  physics class you wanted?
  Cut to: 
  20      INT.    ANYA'S APARTMENT 
    - DAY
    Halfrek is sitting on couch visiting, talking to Anya.
HALFREK
    This is just wonderful, Anyanka. There's even talk of having some sort of 
    ceremony. I can't tell you how many times today I've heard "Anyanka is 
    back to her old self again." (Anya looks troubled) Honey, what is it? 
    What's wrong?
ANYA
    It's nothing. I just— There was just so much screaming, so much blood. 
    (Hallie smiles, imagining it) I— I forgotten how much damage a Grimslaw 
    demon could do.
HALFREK
  Oh, tell me about it. They can be feisty little guys and impossible to house 
  train. I mean, once they start nesting, forget— Are you OK? Oh, did something 
  happen?
ANYA
  I-I guess I'm just a little rusty. I didn't think it would hit me like this. 

HALFREK
  Oh, sweetie. This is perfectly normal. It's a reflex. You'll get over it in 
  no time, trust me.
ANYA
  Oh, Hallie! I can't tell you how good it is— Thank goodness you're here. 
HALFREK
  Oh, sweetie. Of course.
ANYA
  It's just lately, with everything that's been going on, I-I've had trouble even 
  remembering—
  Willow walks into the room.
WILLOW
  (sternly, to Hallie) Get out.
HALFREK
  Lemon drop, if you think I'm gonna—
WILLOW
  Get out. 
  Halfrek looks at Anya.
ANYA
  It's OK.
HALFREK
  Well, OK. If you need anything, you holler.
  Halfrek teleports out of the apartment with her trademark exit (see 7x14 
    "Older and Far Away").
WILLOW
  Anya, you have to stop this. 
  ANYA
    (picks up teacups from coffee table) Do you know what they did to her? Do 
    you? (takes teacups into kitchen) It was a game. They were humiliating her. 
  
WILLOW
  Anya, listen to me. You're in trouble. You know it. I'm here to help you.
ANYA
  (chuckles) You're here to— Well, that's great, Willow. Flayed anybody lately, 
  have you? How quickly they forget!
WILLOW
  I haven't forgotten one second of it. 
ANYA
  What do you want?
WILLOW
  I want to help you.
ANYA
  They got what they deserved.
WILLOW
  No, they—
ANYA
  I am a vengeance demon! Do you understand that?
WILLOW
  No.
ANYA
  Try! They got what they deserved.
  Cut to: 
  21      INT.    WOODS IN 
    SUNNYDALE - DAY
    Buffy and Xander are walking through the woods on a trail, looking for the 
    spider demon. Xander is carrying a sword, and Buffy has her battle-axe.
BUFFY
  Thanks for side-kicking. I didn't want to trouble Willow. Figure she's got enough 
  to do. First day back and all.
XANDER
  Are you kidding? We're doing vent work at the site. Anything's better than breathing 
  freon for eight hours. (beat) So, did she say what this thing is?
BUFFY
  Some sort of spider demony thingy. She had to go pretty quickly. I think she 
  had to sign up for classes or something.
XANDER
  Ah, yes, there is little that can distract the Willow when she's on the hunt 
  for the mighty syllabi.
BUFFY
  I don't know. I guess she was a little more nervous than she was letting on.
  They stumble across a boy's body. The heart has been ripped out. Xander 
    starts hyperventilating.
XANDER
  How big did she say this thing was?
BUFFY
  She didn't. But I can't imagine she'd send us out if it wasn't— The heart is 
  completely ripped out. This is our guy.
XANDER
  Or a copycat spider demon. So what's this black stuff?
  There's black stringy things hanging on the nearby tree. Xander touches 
    it.
XANDER
  Aw, it's sticky!
BUFFY
  Willow said it was a spider demon. Maybe it's its webbing.
XANDER
  This isn't springy high-flying fun.
  A noise comes from the tree above them, like something's moving around in 
    it.
BUFFY
  (looking up) Xander.
XANDER
  Is that it?
BUFFY
  I can't tell. There is definitely something moving up there. 
XANDER
  Maybe we can somehow lure it.
  One of the sticky black webs is shot down from the tree, landing on Xander's 
    shoulder. He dives out of the way. 
BUFFY
  Xander!
  The spider jumps out of the tree, knocks Buffy down to the ground, and 
    lands on top of her. She squirms, but can't get free, as the spider demon's 
    second mouth comes out to try and bite her face. She pushes it off, and it 
    scurries away. She grabs her battle-axe off the ground and looks up in the 
    tree for the spider demon.
BUFFY
  You OK?
XANDER
  Buffy, where'd it go? I think we need more swords.
BUFFY
  (still looking up into the tree) Uh-huh.
XANDER
  I say we go home, pick up more swords, and some sort of spidery demon protection 
  amulet. We come back, and—
  Buffy who has never stopped tracking the spider demon in the tree, throws 
    her battle-axe up into the treetop. The spider falls to the ground with the 
    axe in it.
XANDER
  Or—
  Cut to: 
  22      INT.    BUFFY'S HOUSE 
    - DAY
    Xander and Buffy come home covered in huge scrapes and gashes. 
BUFFY
  I'm more concerned with where that thing came from. If there are more of those 
  spider demons running around, we need to know about it. We should hit the research, 
  find out if—
  Buffy and Xander walk into the living room to see Willow is waiting for 
    them.
  WILLOW
    I know where it came from.
  Buffy and Xander sit down beside each other on the couch, facing Willow 
    who's in the chair.
BUFFY
  How many?
WILLOW
  Ten, twelve.
XANDER
  When were you planning on telling us?
WILLOW
  I'm telling you now.
XANDER
  Great. Thank you. Willow, it's Anya. How could you let us— How could you not 
  have told us? 
BUFFY
  Xander...
XANDER
  How could you not have told me?
BUFFY
  Xander. It's OK. She didn't tell us for a reason. She didn't tell us because 
  she knows what I have to do. (Xander looks from Willow to Buffy) I have to kill 
  Anya. 
  Fade to black.
  ACT III:
  23      INT.    BANQUET HALL 
    - NIGHT
    Generals and such are slumped over onto their dinner plates, while Anya and 
    Halfrek chat it up at the head of the table. There is a window behind them, 
    showing a battle going on outside. The girls are wearing Victorian outfits 
    with the feathered hats and elaborate jewelry, etc. and sipping champagne.
  TITLE CARD: St. Petersburg, 1905.
HALFREK
  I swear, I'm in awe of you.
ANYA
  Oh, stop. 
HALFREK
  Oh, I will not. 
ANYA
  I grant wishes. It's all inside the girl. I just bring it out.
HALFREK
  Yes, I'm sure this is what she had in mind.
ANYA
  Well, I don't know about her mind, but it was in her heart. Besides, Russia 
  was ready to explode. All we did is just give it a little push.
HALFREK
  What should we do with the rest of our evening? I hear they're going to raze 
  the Winter Mansion.
ANYA
  Well, I thought we'd head on down to Madame Dubasov's. No better spot for vengeance 
  than a brothel.
HALFREK
  Oh, it's always work, work, work with you.
  A man comes into the room on fire, and the girls don't even flinch. They 
    just carry on their conversations without noticing him or helping him.
ANYA
  Well, of course. What else is there?
HALFREK
  What else is there? Why, the whole world, for one. Darling, take a look around. 
  There's a lot to see. There's a revolution going on outside that you are somewhat 
  responsible for. Aren't you the teeniest bit interested?
ANYA
  Well, what is there to be interested in? The worker will overthrow absolutism 
  and lead the proletariat to a victorious communist revolution, resulting in 
  socio-economic paradise on earth. It's common sense, really. I have better things 
  to worry about.
HALFREK
  But, Anyanka, there's a whole world out there.
ANYA
  Yes, filled with wronged women who need my help.
HALFREK
  Oh, but you're talking work. 
ANYA
  I'm talking about life. Vengeance is what I do, Halfrek. I don't need anything 
  else. Vengeance is what I am.

  24      INT.    LIVING ROOM 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Resume conversation about Buffy killing Anya. Xander, Willow, and Buffy are 
    talking.
BUFFY
  She's not the Anya that you knew, Xander. She's a demon.
XANDER
  That doesn't mean you have to kill her.
BUFFY
  Don't act like this is easy for me. You know it's not.
XANDER
  There are other options. 
BUFFY
  I've considered them.
XANDER
  When? Just now? Took you all of ten seconds to decide to kill one of your best 
  friends?
BUFFY
  The thought that it might come to this has occurred to me before. It's occurred 
  to you, too.
XANDER
  But we can change what she did. Fix it. These are mystical deaths, right? There 
  has to be something. 
WILLOW
  I don't have anywhere near that kind of power. I didn't have that kind of power 
  when— And I-I don't think I trust the power I do have. 
BUFFY
    (to Willow) It's OK. (turns to Xander) Xander, I know this is hard for you 
    to hear, but it's what I have to do. 
XANDER
  Hard for me to hear? Buffy, you wanna kill Anya!
BUFFY
  I don't want to.
XANDER
  Then don't! This isn't new ground for us. When our friends go all crazy and 
  start killing people, we help them. (looks at Willow)
WILLOW
  Sitting right here.
XANDER
  I'm sorry. But it's true. 
BUFFY
  It's different.
XANDER
  Because you don't care about her the same way I do. Buffy, I still love her.
BUFFY
    I know. And that's why you can't see this for what it really is. Willow was 
    different. She's a human. Anya's a demon.
XANDER
  And you're the slayer. I see now how it's all very simple.
BUFFY
  It is never simple.
XANDER
  (stands) No, of course not. You know, if there's a mass-murdering demon that 
  you're, oh, say, boning, then it's all gray area. 
BUFFY
  Spike was harmless. He was helping.
XANDER
  He had no choice. 
BUFFY
  And Anya did! She chose to become a demon. Twice.
XANDER
  You have no idea what she's going through.
BUFFY
  (stands) I don't care what she's going through!
XANDER
  No, of course not. You think we haven't seen all this before? The part where 
  you just cut us all out. Just step away from everything human and act like you're 
  the law. If you knew what I felt—
BUFFY
  I killed Angel! Do you even remember that? I would have given up everything 
  I had to be with— I loved him more than I will ever love anything in this life. 
  And I put a sword through his heart because I had to. 
WILLOW
  And that all worked out OK. 
BUFFY
  Do you remember cheering me on? Both of you. Do you remember giving me Willow's 
  message: Kick his ass.
WILLOW
  I never said that—
XANDER
  This is different—
BUFFY
  It is always different! It's always complicated. And at some point, someone 
  has to draw the line, and that is always going to be me. You get down on me 
  for cutting myself off, but in the end the slayer is always cut off. There's 
  no mystical guidebook. No all-knowing council. Human rules don't apply. There's 
  only me. I am the law. 
XANDER
  There has to be another way.
BUFFY
  Then please find it.
  Xander takes his coat and leaves. Buffy goes to the tool chest and grabs 
    a sword. She looks at Willow, wanting her to follow, but Willow doesn't move.
WILLOW
  I can't. I'm sorry.
  Buffy leaves the house, sword in hand.
  Cut to:
  25      INT.    WILLOW'S 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Willow goes to her desk and looks frantically through the drawers. Finally, 
    she finds what she's looking for. An amulet.
  Cut to:
  26      INT.    BATHROOM 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Willow pours sand on the floor in a circle while chanting in Latin and holding 
    the amulet. 
WILLOW
    Beatum sit in nomine D'Hoffrynis. Fiat hoc spatium porta ad mundum Arashmaharris. 
  
  A bright flash of light, then D'Hoffryn appears, facing away from Willow.
D'HOFFRYN
    (low) Behold, D'Hoffryn. Lord of Arashmahar. He that turns the air to blood 
    and rains— (turns to Willow, speaking normally) Miss Rosenberg. How lovely 
    to see you again. Have you done something with your hair?
WILLOW
  Hello, D'Hoffryn.
D'HOFFRYN
  I figured I'd be hearing from you soon. The flaying of Warren Meers? Oh, truly 
  inspired. That was water cooler vengeance. Lloyd has a sketch of it on his wall.
WILLOW
  That's not me anymore.
D'HOFFRYN
  Is that right? So, I didn't feel your presence earlier today? I didn't feel 
  a bit of the old you?
WILLOW
  We need to talk about Anya.
D'HOFFRYN
  (growls) Very well. Let's talk about Anyanka.
  Cut to:
  27      INT.    FRAT HOUSE 
    AT U.C. SUNNYDALE - NIGHT
    Anya is thoughtfully touching the wall where blood spattered it. A door opens.
XANDER
  I thought I might find you here. Have you forced yourself to look at the bodies 
  yet?
ANYA
  What do you want?
XANDER
  I want to help you. 
ANYA
  (sighs, walks away) Everyone is so considerate today. I should've slaughtered 
  people weeks ago. 
XANDER
  I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything I did to you. Everything I put you through. 

ANYA
  Thank you. All better. Thank goodness you got here in time.
XANDER
  You don't understand. This isn't an intervention. Buffy's coming to kill you. 

ANYA
  She's coming to try.
XANDER
  Did everybody have their crazy flakes today? You guys are friends. How could 
  you talk like this?
ANYA
  I have a job to do. And so does Buffy. Xander, you've always seen what you wanted 
  to. But you knew, sooner or later, it would come to this. 
XANDER
  (Buffy enters, he turns to face her) Buffy, get out of here.
BUFFY
  Get out of my way, Xander.
XANDER
  No. (turns back to Anya)
ANYA
  (in demon face) Get out of her way, Xander. 
  Anya backhands Xander and he falls down out of the way. Buffy lunges at 
    her with the sword, but Anya pushes her off. They continue to fight during 
    the dialogue.  
ANYA
  This is getting to be a pattern with you, Buffy. Are there any friends of your 
  left you haven't tried to kill? (fighting) C'mon, Buffy. Don't you have a clever 
  retort for me? (fighting) 
  The fighting is fairly even, or Anya may appear to have the slight upper 
    hand. Buffy is thrown onto the floor. She looks up at Anya:
BUFFY
  Anya, I'm sorry. (stands)
ANYA
  You're apologizing to me. What fight are you watching? Or is this like one of 
  your little pop-culture references I don't get, 'cause I'm a vengeance—
  Anya lunges at Buffy who presses her against the wall and stabs her in the 
    heart with her sword. Anya groans.
  Fade to black.
  ACT IV:
  28      INT.    XANDER'S APARTMENT 
    - NIGHT
    Xander is asleep in a recliner and Anya's on the couch reading. Xander's talking 
    in his sleep.
XANDER
  (asleep) I just want... happy... ending... 
ANYA
  Honey? Honey? 
XANDER
  (asleep) What? I'm awake. I'm OK.
ANYA
  Honey? Was that weird? That thing earlier with the singing... and the coconuts. 

XANDER
  (asleep) What? No, it's fine. 
  Singing can be heard through the balcony window.
  NEIGHBOR MAN (O.S.)
  (singing) Oh, no. Mustard on my shirt.
  NEIGHBOR WOMAN (O.S.)
  (singing) Mustard. I'll never get it out. 
  NEIGHBOR MAN (O.S.)
  (singing) My favorite red shirt.
  NEIGHBOR WOMAN (O.S.)
  (singing) Dry clean it. 
  NEIGHBOR MAN (O.S.)
  (singing) How could you serve—
  NEIGHBORS (O.S.)
  (singing) Mustard. 
  Anya shuts the balcony door. 
ANYA
  Are you still hungry? Because I'd be— (looks fondly at Xander sleeping)
  (singing) Mr. Xander Harris. (walks to him) 
  That's what he is to the world outside. 
  That's the name he carries with pride. (puts away his hard hat and tool box)
  I'm just lately Anya. 
  Not very much to the world, I know.
  All these years with nothing to show. (puts away his shoes)
  I've boned a troll, I've wreaked some wrath, 
  But on the whole, I've had no path. (twirling)
  I like to bowl, I'm good with math, 
  But who am I? (kneeling)
  Now I reply that 
  I'm the Missis (looks at engagement ring)
  I will be his Missis.
  Mrs. Anya Christina Emanuella Jenkins Harris. (twirling, dancing)
  What's the point of loving...
  I mean except for the sweaty part. (gathers pillows)
  What's the point of losing your heart?
  Maybe if you're lucky
  Being a pair makes you twice as tall. (gathers a blanket)
  Maybe you're not losing at all. (opens blanket) 
  No need to cover up my heart, (spreads blanket on Xander)
  Plus see above RE: sweaty part. 
  So maybe love is pretty smart
  And so am I 
  I found my guy!
  And I'll be Missis (sits on his lap while the recliner spins)
  I will be his Missis
  Mrs. Anya Lame-Ass-Made-Up-Maiden-Name Harris.
  We'll never part (walks into the kitchen)
  Not if we can
  And if we start
  Then here's my plan
  I'll show him what bliss is
  Welcome him with kisses
  'Cause this is a Missis who misses her man
  He's my Xander
  And he's awfully swell
  It makes financial sense as well,
  Although he can be—I'll never tell—
  Just stand aside
  Here comes the bride (goes through balcony door, and is suddenly in wedding 
  gown)
  I'll be Missis.
  I will be his Missis
  I will be—
  Cut to:
  29      INT.    FRAT HOUSE 
    AT U.C. SUNNYDALE - NIGHT
    Resume. Buffy has just stabbed Anya through the heart with her sword. Anya, 
    in human face, is slumped, but hasn't fallen. Xander regains consciousness 
    and is still on the floor. He looks over and sees Anya's condition.
XANDER
  Anya!
  Anya face is tear-streaked and bloody. Suddenly, she gasps for air and opens 
    her eyes. She looks down at the sword in her chest.
ANYA
    Forgotten how much swords through the chest hurt. (pulls it out) Aaahh! (breathes 
    heavily) You know better than that, Buffy. It takes a lot more to kill a vengeance 
    demon.
BUFFY
  Oh, I'm just getting started. 
  Anya comes at Buffy with the sword. Buffy pushes a stool at her, knocking 
    her off balance. She falls to the floor, dropping the sword. Anya's lying 
    with her back on the floor. Buffy takes the sword, straddles Anya, and prepares 
    for another thorough double-fisted stabbing of Anya. Xander pushes Buffy out 
    of the way. They all stand up.
ANYA
  Stop trying to save me, Xander!
  Lightening bolts flash in the room knocking everyone down, then D'Hoffryn 
    appears. 
D'HOFFRYN
  Oh, please, don't mind me. Continue with whatever it was you were doing. (walks 
  to look in an adjacent room) Oh, breathtaking. It's like somebody slaughtered 
  an Abercrombie and Fitch catalog. (Buffy stands and grabs her sword) Easy now. 
  I'd be gone before you could swing. (sighs, offers a hand to Anya to help her 
  stand) Isn't that just like a slayer. Solving all her problems by sticking things 
  with sharp objects. I talked to your friend, Miss Rosenberg. She's a firebrand. 
  I have high hopes for her.
XANDER
  Stay away from Willow.
D'HOFFRYN
  (to Anya) Oh, he's gallant, isn't he. I understand what you saw in him. (to 
  all) Look, Miss Rosenberg seems to think Anyanka would be better suited outside 
  the vengeance fold. I think we already know what Lady HacksAway wants. And the 
  young man, he sees with the eyeballs of love. But I'm not sure if anyone's bothered 
  to find out what Anyanka herself really wants. 
XANDER
  Her name is Anya.
D'HOFFRYN
  Actually, funny historical side-bar, her original name was—
ANYA
  (crying) I wanna take it back. 
D'HOFFRYN
  I'm sorry. What was that?
ANYA
  I wanna take it back. I wanna undo what I did.
D'HOFFRYN
  Hmm. You want to take it back. Must be twelve bodies in there. Such a thing—not 
  easily done. But not impossible. You're a big girl, Anyanka. You understand 
  how this works. The proverbial scales must balance. In order to restore the 
  lives of the victims, the fates require a sacrifice. The life and soul of a 
  vengeance demon. 
ANYA
  Do it.
XANDER
  Wait!
ANYA
  Stay out of this Xander. 
XANDER
  OK, all right. That seems smart. He just said you have to die! Perhaps there's 
  some sort of alternate price.
ANYA
  Xander, you can't help me. I'm not even sure there's a me to help. (to D'Hoffryn) 
  I understand the price. Do it.
D'HOFFRYN
  You're sure? This is your wish?
ANYA
  This is my wish. Undo what I did.
D'HOFFRYN
  Very well. 
  D'Hoffryn gestures with his hands, and a flash of light appears. 
XANDER
  No!
  Where the flash was, Halfrek shows up, smiling sweetly.
HALFREK
  Anya!
  Anya looks at D'Hoffryn, realizing what's going to happen.
ANYA
  Hallie!
  Halfrek bursts into flames and light shoots out of her eyes. She shrieks 
    and disappears. Anya starts to cry as D'Hoffryn berates her. 
D'HOFFRYN
  Who did you think you were dealing with? Did you think it would be that easy 
  to get away?
ANYA
  Why?
D'HOFFRYN
  Why? Because you wished it!
ANYA
  But she was yours.
D'HOFFRYN
  Like you were mine? Haven't I taught you anything, Anya? Never go for the kill 
  when you can go for the pain. (Xander starts for D'Hoffryn, but Buffy stops 
  him) Hold him back, Slayer. Wouldn't want anyone to get hurt. I've got plenty 
  of girls. There will always be vengeance demons. But now you, Anya, you're out. 
  Congratulations. You're wish is granted.
ANYA
  You should've killed me.
D'HOFFRYN
  Oh, I wouldn't worry about that. From beneath you, it devours. Be patient. All 
  good things in time.
  In a flash, D'Hoffryn disappears. Anya looks at Xander and Buffy and walks 
    out.
  BUFFY
  (to Xander) Go. I'll check on the boys.
  Cut to:
  30     EXT.    FRAT HOUSE 
    AT U.C. SUNNYDALE - NIGHT
    Xander follows Anya outside the fraternity house. 
XANDER
  Anya, wait.
ANYA
  Xander, please. Just go away. 
XANDER
  Whatever's between us—it doesn't matter. You shouldn't be alone in this.
ANYA
  Yes, I should. My whole life, I've just clung to whatever came along. 
XANDER
  Well, speaking as a clingee— I kinda didn't mind. 
ANYA
  Thanks. For everything. 
  Xander nods, realizing that this is her rejecting his offer to help.
ANYA
  Xander— what if I'm really nobody?
XANDER
  Don't be a dope.
ANYA
  I'm a dope?
XANDER
  Sometimes. 
ANYA
  That's a start. 
  Xander walks away, leaving a teary-eyed Anya to deal alone.
  Cut to: 
  Closing credits.
