    STREET IN FRONT OF MAGIC BOX - DAY
    Willow is walking down the street toward the old Magic Box storefront. It's 
    burned and boarded up. Anya comes out the front door with a box full of salvaged 
    items. Willow runs up to her, excited to see her.
  WILLOW
  Anya!
  ANYA
  I thought you were with Giles studying how to not kill people.
WILLOW
  I just got back.

    Principal Wood is showing her around on her first day at work. Buffy has a 
    cubicle near a hallway window. 
BUFFY
  I was, uh, wondering why I—
PRINCIPAL
  —have this job?
BUFFY
  I still haven't finished college.
PRINCIPAL
    These students need someone around here who understands them; I need someone 
    who understands these students. 
  Fade to black.

The Start Of Episode
  Prologue:
  6     INT.     MORTUARY 
    SOMEWHERE IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT
    A woman in her fifties is laid out in a coffin.
  MORTUARY MAN 1 (O.S.)
  You did good work on her. She looks good.
  MORTUARY MAN 2 (O.S.)
  Thanks. She's all set for the service tomorrow.
  Two men in black suits walk past the coffin.
  MORTUARY MAN 1 (O.S.)
  Good. All right then. I'll see you in the morning. 
  MORTUARY MAN 2 (O.S.)
  G'night.
  They turn the light off on their way out and shut the door. Pan out. There 
    are several other closed coffins in the room. A few seconds later, one of 
    the other coffins opens, and Buffy climbs out with a flashlight. Then Xander 
    climbs out of another coffin.
XANDER
  Hey.
BUFFY
  (jumps) Sorry.
  XANDER
    33 minutes. Since when do we go through all this trouble for one lousy vampire. 
    Excuse me, one lousy potential vampire.
  BUFFY
    Vampire by vampire. It's the only way I know how.
  There's a knocking sound from one of the smaller coffins. Buffy and Xander 
    go to open it, and Dawn, who was fairly cramped, gets out, gasping for air.
DAWN
  I think this thing has a freakin' child lock on it.
BUFFY
  Shh!
DAWN
  You know, I'm not the shortest one here. I don't know why I had to be in the 
  kid coffin.
BUFFY
  Look, I know it's my job—
XANDER
  No, no. I'm sorry. I wanna help. I guess I've been a bit stressed out lately. 
  I'm sorry I took it out on you.
BUFFY
  No big. Been kinda stressed myself.
DAWN
  Well, the whole Willow sitch is not unstressifying.I mean she's here, but not 
  "part of the gang" here and hopefully not "under my feet here 
  in another time dimension" here.
BUFFY
    There's Willow. There's the looming humongo bad. And it's a school night. 
    I should be home in bed, cuddled up to my insomnia, and worrying about how 
    I'm gonna mess up tomorrow.
DAWN
  You'll be fine. You'll be a great counselor.
BUFFY
  It's my first week actually talking to the kids. What if their problems are 
  all weird and tricky?
XANDER
  I think you underestimate your familiarity with the world of weird and tricky. 
  This job's perfect for you.
BUFFY
  Check out perfect me. 
  Buffy walks toward the casket containing the dead woman. Dawn and Xander 
    follow her. Buffy shines the flashlight in the dead woman's face, inspecting 
    her.
BUFFY
  Taking my sister on an educational outing to the—
DAWN
  Dead body.
XANDER
  I don't know. Amateur opinion here, but she looks dead. I mean like natural 
  causes dead. 
BUFFY
  The paper said she had unusual cuts and contusions on her neck.
  Buffy shines the flashlight on the dead woman's neck, and right below her 
    pearl necklace there are two puncture wounds that have been stitched up.
XANDER
  Maybe she cut herself shaving and then died naturally of embarrassment.
  Buffy hands the flashlight to Xander.
DAWN
  She looks...
BUFFY
  Peaceful.
  The woman in the casket opens her eyes, and they're yellow, like a vampire's.
  DEAD WOMAN
  I am not peaceful.
BUFFY
  That, I can help with.
  Buffy takes out a stake and plunges it into the lady's heart, turning her 
    into dust.
BUFFY
  I always thought closed caskets were more tasteful anyway.
  Buffy closes the lid to the woman's casket.

  ACT I.

  7     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    CUBICLE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    School is in session. There are students wandering the halls. Buffy is arranging 
    and rearranging her desk. Then she decides to sharpen all her pencils. A student 
    walks up to her mid-sharpening. The girl, skinny with long brown hair, looks 
    kind of timid and introverted.
  INTROVERTED GIRL
  Hello?
BUFFY
  (startled) Come in! (hides the pencils) Hi.
  INTROVERTED GIRL
  Mr. Miller sent me here.
BUFFY
  Do you know why?
  INTROVERTED GIRL
  I'm not sure. Maybe 'cause this guy was picking on me.
  Cut to: 
  8     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    CUBICLE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    A young, tough-looking boy is standing in Buffy's cubicle wearing a grey hooded 
    sweatshirt with the hood pulled up over his head.
  TOUGH BOY
  I don't wanna talk to you.
BUFFY
  OK. That's fine.
  TOUGH BOY
  I'm serious. I don't wanna talk.
BUFFY
  OK.
  Cut to: 
  9     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    CUBICLE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    A tall, good-looking, confident boy is talking to Buffy. He's wearing a stylish 
    knit sport shirt and looks kind of preppy.
  CONFIDENT BOY
  You know, I hate to miss Bio, but I thought it was best I come speak with you.
BUFFY
  So, what's on your mind?
  CONFIDENT BOY
  On my mind?
BUFFY
  Are you worried about school? Uh, friends, girls, your parents?
  CONFIDENT BOY
  Yeah, yeah, that's it. My parents.
BUFFY
  What about them?
  CONFIDENT BOY
  Oh, issues... of divorce.
  Cut to:
  10     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    CUBICLE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Resume Buffy's conversation with the introverted girl.
BUFFY
  You know, it's awful... being teased. But the thing is, you know, with bullies 
  like this, they're really just—
  INTROVERTED GIRL
  Insecure? Yeah, everyone says that. You know, I'm really tired of everyone being 
  so insecure.
  Cut to: 
  11     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    CUBICLE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Resume Buffy's conversation with the tough boy. He is staring at her with 
    his best tough face. He sits down at Buffy's desk.
  Cut to: 
  12     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    CUBICLE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Resume Buffy's conversation with confident boy.
BUFFY
  Divorce is terrible. My parents got divorced when I was a kid.
  CONFIDENT BOY
    Yeah, my parents are happily married. (Buffy glares) It's hard. Uh, I feel... 
    left out. B-but I'm also concerned about girls. (laughs nervously) OK, I'm 
    just bored. Maybe I should get back to Bio?
  Buffy nods, and the boy walks away.
  Cut to: 
  13     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    CUBICLE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Resume Buffy's conversation with the introverted girl.
BUFFY
    You have to stick up for yourself, Amanda. You need to show this bully that 
    you're not gonna take any more of his sh—guff. Uh, any guff.
  AMANDA/INTROVERTED GIRL
  'Cause that's what I did. I stuck up for myself. The other day after class, 
  I jumped him in the parking lot, and I slammed his stupid-ass insecure face 
  right into the pavement.
BUFFY
  You what?
  AMANDA
  I guess that's another reason Mr. Miller wanted me to see you. (Buffy sighs) 
  Do you think I should pound on him some more?
  Cut to: 
  14     EXT.     PARK 
    IN SUNNYDALE - DAY
    Willow and Xander are walking through a park, talking. Willow's wearing black.
XANDER
  I bet she's giving them great advice.
WILLOW
  Absolutely! Those kids are lucky to have Buffy looking out for them. I just 
  wish she believed it. She's still stressing over the whole "dropped out 
  of college, not actually qualified" thing. Plus the salivating hellmouth 
  underneath her feet and the whole—
XANDER
  From beneath you, it devours. It's not the friendliest jingle, is it? It's no 
  "I like Ike" or "Milk: it does a body good."
WILLOW
  I know. It's gonna be bad. It's gonna be real bad. And I wonder, will I— Well, 
  if it comes— When it comes, will I be able to help?
XANDER
  I think so.
WILLOW
  I don't know. I don't know what I can do. I mean, frankly, I'm—I'm scared of 
  what I might do.
XANDER
    Yeah, I get that. Figuring out how to control your magic seems a lot like 
    hammering a nail. (Willow looks confused) Well, uh, hear me out. So you're 
    hammering, right? OK, well at the end of the hammer, you have the power, but 
    no control. It takes, like, two strokes to hit the nail in, or you could hit 
    your thumb.
WILLOW
  Ouch.
XANDER
  So you choke up. Control, but no power. It could take like ten strokes to knock 
  the nail in. Power, control. It's a tradeoff.
WILLOW
  That's actually not a bad analogy.
XANDER
  Thanks.
WILLOW
    Except... I'm less worried about hitting my thumb, and more worried about 
    going all black-eyed baddy and bewitching that hammer into cracking my friends' 
    skulls open like coconuts.
XANDER
    Right. Ouch.
WILLOW
  Sorry. (beat) Xander, being back here... I don't know...
XANDER
  It'll take time. (sighs, they stop walking) Are you sure you're ready for this?
  Willow nods and walks forward without Xander. Pan out to show they are 
    at a graveyard now. Willow walks by herself past many graves before coming 
    up to a tombstone. She puts a handful of rocks on the headstone, and kneels 
    in front of it. The following text is carved on the stone:
  Tara Maclay
    Oct 16, 1980 - May 7, 2002
WILLOW
  Hey.
  Willow touches Tara's name on the headstone.
WILLOW
  It's me.
  Cut to: 
  15     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    CUBICLE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Resume Buffy's conversation with the tough boy. He is sitting down at Buffy's 
    desk.
  TOUGH BOY
  I'm scared. I don't want to be left all alone. My brother's joining up with 
  the Marines. Whew. You know, if he knew I was making a fool of myself, he'd 
  smack me in my head. I guess I'm just being stupid.
BUFFY
  Sounds like your brother's pretty tough.
  TOUGH BOY
  Yeah, he's a man. I'm just all messed up right now.
BUFFY
  You are not messed up. It is not messed up to worry about your brother.
  TOUGH BOY
  What if he doesn't come back? What if he gets blown up?
BUFFY
  Have you talked to him? Have you told him how you feel?
  TOUGH BOY
  No. No, I don't wanna talk to him. I don't wanna do that. I don't wanna talk 
  to him.
BUFFY
  OK.
  TOUGH BOY
  You understand?
  Cut to: 
  16     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    CUBICLE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Buffy's counseling a nerd boy now. He's wearing a crystal pendant necklace 
    and horn-rimmed glasses.
BUFFY
  So, Josh, what's on your mind?
  JOSH
  Well, I'm worried that I'm... gay.
BUFFY
  OK, first of all, I... I think it's great that you would come and talk to me 
  about this. And second of all, you should know that there is nothing shameful 
  about being gay. Nothing.
  JOSH
  I-I know. It's just—I'm not positive, so, uh, I was thinking that... why don't 
  you go on, uh, a date with me so I can be sure.
  Josh flashes his crooked-toothed smile at Buffy while she shakes her head 
    in disbelief and sighs.
  Cut to: 
  17     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    CUBICLE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Buffy is counseling yet another student. She seems flustered with this student, 
    holding her head in her hand before finally speaking.
BUFFY
  It sounds like it's difficult for you. Like maybe your sister makes it hard 
  for you to establish your own identity. You said she's controlling, she doesn't 
  let you make your own decisions—
  The student she's counseling turns out to be Dawn, who's sporting an attitude.
DAWN
  Yeah, and she borrows my clothes without asking.
BUFFY
    I understand. That must be hard.  Cut to: 
  18     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    CUBICLE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Buffy's now counseling a girl who doesn't quite fit any stereotype. She's 
    wearing a black t-shirt and purple streaks in her blonde hair.
BUFFY
  So, you're not doing your homework.
  GIRL
  I guess not. It all just... seems kind of ... whatever.
BUFFY
  I know high school can seem kind of frustrating. But if you just get through 
  it, then you can go to college, you know, or you can join the French Foreign 
  Legion, or anything you want.
  GIRL
  (smiles) Yeah, well, I'm not gonna do all that stuff.
BUFFY
  OK, no Foreign Legion. I get that. I mean all the changing your name, and being 
  indentured for all those years, and occupying Algeria...
  GIRL
  (laughs) It's just that I'm not graduating from high school.
BUFFY
  Why not?
  GIRL
  I really like that shirt. Where'd you get it?
BUFFY
  Cassie, don't change the subject. Why won't you graduate?
  CASSIE/GIRL
  (seriously) Because next Friday I'm gonna die.
  Fade to black.
  ACT II.
  19     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    CUBICLE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Resume conversation between Buffy and Cassie.
BUFFY
  What?
CASSIE
  Can we talk about something else?
BUFFY
  No, we have to talk about this.
CASSIE
  Just... never mind.
BUFFY
  Cassie, what makes you feel like this?
CASSIE
  Feel like what?
BUFFY
  Like you wanna hurt yourself.
CASSIE
  Oh, I'm— (laughs) I'm not gonna commit suicide if—if that's what you're saying. 
  No way.
BUFFY
  (confused) OK then. Then what are you saying?
CASSIE
  Look, I don't mean to be a pain. You seem really nice, and I know you're just 
  trying to help. But I'm wasting your time.
BUFFY
    No you're not. This is why I'm here. Cassie, please tell me, why do you think 
    you're gonna die?
CASSIE
  I don't think it, I know it. I just know.
BUFFY
  What do you mean, you know? A-are you saying that someone's going to hurt you? 
  Has someone threatened you?
CASSIE
  No. (beat) No, I just know that next Friday I'm gonna die. Some things I just 
  know. I don't know how, I just do. (beat) Like I know there will be coins—
BUFFY
  Coins?
CASSIE
  Mm-hmm. Lots of coins. Weird ones. And I know that you'll go someplace dark 
  underground. I-I don't know.
BUFFY
  What do you mean underground?
CASSIE
  And I know you'll try to help—
BUFFY
  Cassie, I-I don't understand what you're saying.
CASSIE
  But you can't, OK? I gotta go. (stands up, gathers her things) Trig. I don't 
  want Mr. Corrigan sending me Principal Wood again.
BUFFY
  Cassie, please—
CASSIE
    Thanks for being so nice. I really do like that shirt. (touches her own shoulder) 
    You should put a sweater on so it doesn't get stained. I gotta go. (walks 
    away)
BUFFY
  (stands) Cassie, wait, please—
CASSIE
  Gotta go.
  Cut to:
  20     INT.     PRINCIPAL'S 
    OFFICE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Buffy's standing, panicked, talking to Principal Wood, who's calm, sitting 
    behind his desk.
BUFFY
  What am I supposed to do?
PRINCIPAL
  Well, you did what you were supposed to do. You reported the situation to me.
BUFFY
  And...
PRINCIPAL
    Listen, Buffy, it's hard. Kids this age... they're hurting, they're pissed 
    off, and they say things. Sometimes they say awful things. (stands up, walks 
    to coffee maker, pours coffee) When I was in high school, I had a thing with 
    this guy, right? Real bully. I kept telling everyone that he'd better sleep 
    with one eye open 'cause I was gonna bust his ass. Well, I got suspended. 
    Talk like that is taken pretty seriously where I come from.
BUFFY
  The hood?
  Principal Wood stops pouring his coffee and looks at Buffy.
PRINCIPAL
  Beverly Hills... which is a hood. 
  Buffy looks embarrassed. Principal Wood finishes preparing coffee, and walks 
    toward Buffy with a cup of coffee for each of them. He hands one mug to Buffy.
PRINCIPAL
  Listen, the point is, I was talking big because I was scared. I couldn't bust 
  a move back in high school, let alone someone's ass. Most of the time, that's 
  what it is when these students act out. Fear, pain—
BUFFY
  But sometimes, it's not just talk, right?
PRINCIPAL
  (walking back to sit at desk) Every time there's a threat like this, we do the 
  same dance. Inform teachers, search lockers, but we can't—we can't know what's 
  gonna happen, and we can't search their brains. We just—we just do what we 
  can.
BUFFY
  It's not enough. I need to fix this. I don't usually get a heads up before somebody 
  dies.
PRINCIPAL
  What do you mean usually?
BUFFY
  (animated, talking with hands) No. No, not since—I mean, I'm sure it's not 
  usual to get a chance to stop something like—I just I need to do something, 
  OK? (walks toward Principal's desk) I have to make this better— (trips over 
  something, and spills coffee on her shirt) Oh! Oh, shoot.
  Buffy looks down at the coffee stain on her shirt, and remembers what Cassie 
    said earlier.
  Cut to:
  21     INT.     HALLWAY 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Dawn's opens her locker, and Buffy's standing there when she closes it again.
BUFFY
  I have a job for you.
  Cut to:
  22     INT.     LIBRARY 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Dawn's standing near one of the library stacks, listening in on a conversation 
    between Cassie and guy friend.
  GUY
  What're you drawing?
CASSIE
  Don't you have a history test to study for?
  GUY
  When are you gonna design me a tattoo?
CASSIE
  A tattoo? Oh, right. I could imagine that.
  GUY
  Come on. Design something. I mean, maybe we could get matching tattoos. How 
  'bout like a snake with fire coming out of its mouth.
CASSIE
  Hmm. Or a sexy hula girl who wiggles when you flex?
  GUY
  Yeah, now you're talking. Sexy hula girl. But a sexy snake hula girl.
  Dawn is pretending to read a book while casually making her way toward their 
    conversation.
CASSIE
  (chuckles) You are so ridiculous.
  GUY
  So, I was thinking... maybe we should go to that dance after all.
CASSIE
  What do you mean "after all." I told you I don't wanna go.
  GUY
  Well, I assumed you were kidding.
CASSIE
  It would probably be lame anyways.
  Dawn's standing behind them now.
  GUY
  Well, yeah, but lame is funny… and, you know, maybe fun if, you know, we're 
  hanging out together. 
CASSIE
  We hang out together all the time.
  GUY
  Right. And therefore we should hang out together at the winter formal.
  Dawn walks up to them and interrupts.
DAWN
  (to Cassie) Hey. Um, I'm in ceramics class with you. I'm Dawn Summers. I forgot 
  if we had an assignment last week. I spaced.
CASSIE
  Right. Um. Hey, Dawn. Uh, yeah, you know we did have an assignment, but I didn't 
  write it down. I think something to do with glazes...
  GUY
  As scintillating as the pottery talk is, I'd better actually go study. (gathers 
  his things and stands)(to Dawn) I'm Mike, by the way.
DAWN
  Hi, Mike. I-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to—
  MIKE/GUY
    Oh, don't worry about it. I better go hit the books if I'm gonna ace this 
    test. Nice meeting you, though. Cass, I'll see you later?
CASSIE
  Yep. (Mike walks away) Hey, Mike, you're gonna get a "B".
  MIKE
  Oh, "A+" baby, "A+".
  Dawn notices that Cassie is reading Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse 
    Five. Dawn sits down beside Cassie in the chair Mike vacated.
DAWN
  So, um, is that any good?
CASSIE
  Yeah. Actually, yeah.
DAWN
  What do you have to read it for?
CASSIE
  Oh, just for me, I guess. I kinda stopped reading my homework assignments. I 
  just... read what I want.
DAWN
  That's so cool. I'd do that, but my sister'd be down my neck in a second.
CASSIE
  Summers... hey— are you the counselor's little sister?
DAWN
  No. She's my sister. Lucky me, huh?
CASSIE
  No, no, she's-she's really nice. I actually just saw her this morning.
DAWN
  Oh, really? What about? (beat) Uh, I'm sorry, that's none of my business.
CASSIE
  No, I don't care.
DAWN
  So, Mike's a cutie. Are you guys going to that dance?
CASSIE
  No, I don't think so.
DAWN
  Oh. I mean, didn't he ask you?
CASSIE
  Uh, like 105 times.
DAWN
  And you said no?
CASSIE
  106 times. No, I-I can't go. I'm not gonna be around that night.
  Cut to:
  23     INT.     DINING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Buffy and Xander are gathered around Willow, who's at her laptop on the table.
BUFFY
  Cassie's records all show the same thing. Good grades, good kid, then all of 
  a sudden not so good grades, absenteeism, comments about apathy and depression—
XANDER
  So, the question is, what changed?
BUFFY
  Right. If she did have some sort of psychic vision, that would explain it.
WILLOW
  Do you really think this girl is some kind of precog?
BUFFY
  Oh, I don't know. I told you about the shirt, right?
XANDER
  Buff, you spilled a cup of coffee. I'm not saying you don't have slayer grace, 
  but it's not the first time.
WILLOW
  I mean maybe, just maybe, you're trying so hard to help that you're seeing paranormal 
  when there's just normal.
BUFFY
  Maybe. But maybe not.
WILLOW
  Want me to check her medical records?
BUFFY
  Her doctor already sent them.
  Buffy hands the file to Xander, who flips through it.
XANDER
  (softly) Let me see that. (normal) Strep throat. Ear infections. Yeast infections. 
  None of my business... no real info here.
WILLOW
  Have you googled her yet?
XANDER
  Willow, she's 17.
WILLOW
  It's a search engine. Look. (types on laptop) OK, let's see what "Cassie 
  Newton" pulls up. (computer beeps) Hey, look. Check this. She's got her 
  own site.
  NB: Google 
    is a real web site: www.google.com. Cassie 
    Newton has a web site too, where you can read her poems, etc.: www.cassienewton.com. 
     
XANDER
  A day and a half of researching, and we finally try looking up her.
  Cassie's website is artsy and eccentric. The graphics resemble a collage 
    of words cut from magazines pasted together.
BUFFY
  Wow, that's a lot of poems.
XANDER
  Poems. Always a sign of pretentious inner turmoil.
  WILLOW
    (reading from the website) 
    The sheets above me 
    cool my skin 
    like dirt 
    on a mad woman's grave 
    I rise into 
    the moonlight white 
    and watch 
    the mirror stare 
    Pale fish looks 
    back at me 
    Pale fish that will 
    never swim
    My skin is milk 
    for no man to drink 
    My thighs unused 
    unclenched 
    This body is 
    not ready yet 
    But dirt waits for no 
    woman 
    and coins will 
    buy no time 
    I hear the chatter 
    of the bugs. It's they alone 
    will feast.
  Meanwhile, Dawn has come home.
XANDER
  OK, death is really on her brain.
DAWN
  We all deal with death.
XANDER
  This girl isn't just dealing, she's giving death a long, sloppy word-kiss. She 
  has a yen for the big dirt-nap.
WILLOW
  I don't know. I mean, a lot of teens post some pretty angsty poetry on the web. 
  I mean, I even posted a melodramatic love poem or two back in the day.
XANDER
  Love poems?
WILLOW
  I'm over you now, sweetie.
XANDER
  Love poems!
WILLOW
  Look, all I'm saying is that this is normal teen stuff. You join chat rooms, 
  you write poetry, you post Doogie Howser fan-fic. It's all normal, right? Let's 
  see what other sites there are. (types, computer beeps)
DAWN
  You guys are way off track. I got a hunch on this one.
  No one acknowledges Dawn. They're just looking at the laptop.
WILLOW
  (computer beeps) Oh, wait, no, here's something. No, that's Philip Newton.
BUFFY
  No, that's her dad. Open it.
DAWN
  Guys, I'm telling you. I got this case cracked wide-open. I got the perp fingered. 
  I told you 'bout Mike Helgenberg, right?
BUFFY
  Uh, that's the guy that asked her to the dance?
DAWN
  Right. The one that keeps asking her to the dance. I'm thinking, who likes to 
  be rejected? Nobody. I'm thinking, some people can't handle the rejection. I'm 
  thinking that—
WILLOW
    Hey, I got something. Whoa, drunk and disorderly, disturbing the peace—there's 
    a lot of charges here.
BUFFY
  Her dad's a drunk?
XANDER
  A violent drunk?
BUFFY
  We'd better find out. I have his address right... here. Got your keys?
XANDER
  Yeah.
  Buffy and Xander are leaving without even acknowledging Dawn.
DAWN
  Guys, I'm telling you, I'm liking Mike Helgenberg for the perp. Let's collar 
  him before he— (Buffy and Xander walk out the front door and close it) lawyers 
  up.

    Buffy and Xander are standing on Cassie's dad's front porch, ringing the doorbell.
BUFFY
  Buffy, the vampire slayer, would break down this door.
XANDER
  And Buffy, the counselor?
BUFFY
  Waits.
  Mr. Newton answers the door, but doesn't open the screen door.
BUFFY
  Mr. Newton?
  MR. NEWTON

    Newton.
  MR. NEWTON
  So, is she screwing up her grades again? Because she's not the sharpest apple 
  in the barrel.
BUFFY
  She's got some problems. But it's, um, it's kind of you we wanted to talk about.
  MR. NEWTON
  What about?
BUFFY
  We know you've been picked up by the police a couple of times. We wanted to 
  know if you still— (looks over at the counter top, cluttered with bottles of 
  alcohol) drink a lot.
  MR. NEWTON
  What's that got to do with Cassie?
BUFFY
  Frankly, we were worried that you might—drink too much and hurt Cassie. That's 
  all.
  MR. NEWTON
  Oh. Oh, I see. That's-that's all. You just come in here in the middle of the 
  night, into my home, and start accusing me of beating on my daughter? That's 
  all?
BUFFY
  We just want to make sure that Cassie's—
  MR. NEWTON
  (slurring) Well, that's a lie! Who told you this? Did Cassie's mother put you 
  up to this, 'cause I pay my support, OK? To the dime! She just wants to take 
  away the one weekend a month I get to be with my girl.
BUFFY
  Which is when? 
  MR. NEWTON
  What?
BUFFY
  Which weekend is it?
  MR. NEWTON
  I-I just had her last weekend. (beat) Look, I may not be the greatest dad in 
  the world, but I don't beat up my daughter.
BUFFY
  So, you won't be seeing her this Friday, then?
  MR. NEWTON
  Not unless my ex-wife gets a personality transplant.
BUFFY
  OK.
  MR. NEWTON
  OK, what? OK now you'll get out of my house?
BUFFY
  Yeah, we will.
  Buffy and Xander go back out the front door.

    Buffy and Xander are walking back out to the car when they see Cassie has 
    just pulled into the driveway. Cassie uses remote keyless entry system to 
    lock her car, which beeps.
CASSIE
  It's not him. He's not the one who does it. Thank you for trying, but I probably 
  shouldn't have told you anything. You're making such a big deal out of it, and 
  I want it to all to just go away.
XANDER
  Are you talking about killing yourself?
CASSIE
  No, of course not.
BUFFY
  Then fight. Try.
CASSIE
  There's no point. I told you—
BUFFY
  This doesn't sound like someone who really wants to live.
CASSIE
  You think I want this? You think I don't care? (starts to cry) Believe me, I 
  want to...be here, do things. I want to graduate from high school, and I want 
  to go to the stupid winter formal... (sniffles) I have this friend, and it would 
  be fun to go with him. Just to dance and hear lame music to wear a silly dress 
  and laugh and stuff.(sniffles) I'd like to go. There's a lot of stuff I'd like 
  to do. I'd love to ice skate at Rockefeller Center. And I'd love to see my cousins 
  grow up and see how they turn out 'cause they're really mean and I think they're 
  gonna be fat. I'd love to backpack across the country or, I don't know, fall 
  in love, but I won't. I just never will.
BUFFY
  You will. Cassie, you will. You just have to tell us what you know. You have 
  to tell us everything. Please, help us.
CASSIE
  I can't. I just know it's gonna happen. I don't know why and I don't know how, 
  but something out there is gonna kill me.

    Wood walks up to her.
PRINCIPAL
  Hey, how're we doing? (Buffy sighs) Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
BUFFY
  Oh, no, that's OK. I just didn't get much sleep last night.
PRINCIPAL
  It's been a long week, huh. Well, thank God it's Friday. I can't believe I just 
  said that. See you later. 
  Principal Wood walks away, and Buffy turns back to the computer. She's reading 
    "Poem #5" from Cassie's web site. It looks like scanned handwriting 
    on ruled school paper. It scrolls on the screen while her pastel drawings 
    are displayed in the background.

    Buffy walks around, looking for Spike. When she finds him, he's crouched on 
    the floor. He's got the "bad hair of redemption", unkempt and not 
    slicked back. She walks up to him, and waves her hand in front of his eyes. 
    He doesn't respond. She snaps in front of his face, and he still doesn't respond. 
    She's frustrated, and sighs. She impatient with his moods and games.
BUFFY
  (crosses her arms over her chest) Spike, what are you doing?
SPIKE
  Nothing. If I don't move, if I don't think, if I don't listen to the voices, 
  then I won't hurt...much.
BUFFY
  I need to ask you something.
SPIKE
  Don't.
BUFFY
  There's a girl, she's in danger, and she needs your help. Now. Time is running 
  out. It's Friday, the day Cassie said she's going to die.
SPIKE
  I can't. I can't hear you.
BUFFY
  Is there something evil in the school? Down here, maybe. Spike, please, do you 
  know anything?
SPIKE
  (defeated sigh) Yes. (beat) There's evil. Down here. Right here. I'm a bad man. 
  William is a baaad man. I hurt the girl. (cries)
  Spike starts punching himself violently in the face. 
BUFFY
  (grabs his wrist) Spike, stop it! What did you do?
SPIKE
  I hurt you, Buffy, and I will pay. I am paying because I hurt the girl.
BUFFY
  (tenderly) Spike. No. (lets go of his wrist) It's not me. It's a different girl, 
  OK? Her name is Cassie Newton. Please, do you know anything specific?
  Spike shakes his head "no", and Buffy sighs. She turns to leave, 
    when Spike calls out softly after her.
SPIKE
  Don't—don't leave me. Stay here, and help me be quiet.
BUFFY

PRINCIPAL
  Well, there's nothing in this one. What've you got?
  Mike walks by, and Buffy stops him.
BUFFY
  Where's your hall pass?
  MIKE
  No hall pass. I got a free period. 
  He starts to go on by, but Buffy steps in his way again.
BUFFY
  You seem kind of upset. Something on your mind?
  MIKE
  No, not really. (holds up a graded paper) Well, I got a lousy "B" 
  in Egyptian history. Knew this stuff cold, so that, you know, that pisses me 
  off.
BUFFY
  You get... pissed off a lot?
  MIKE
  No, I—
BUFFY
  Let me cut to the chase. I hear you can't get a date for the winter formal.
  MIKE
  Oh, whoa, look, I know it's your job to talk to kids with problems, but honestly 
  I don't have any. I'm fine. (Buffy seems suspicious) All right, look, it's really 
  no big deal. I have a friend that I really wanted to take—I don't know, I guess 
  she doesn't see me that way. (laughs) She makes me crazy.
BUFFY
  Crazy?
  MIKE
  Yeah, sometimes I jus— That's funny. You're Dawn's sister, right?
BUFFY
  Uh, that's right. Dawn is my sister.
  MIKE
  Oh, that's so weird. I was just thinking about her. Yeah, I was thinking if, 
  you know, Cassie won't budge, maybe I'll ask Dawn.
BUFFY
  You aren't mad at Cassie, with her rejecting you like that?
  MIKE
  Nah, she's a girl right? Making boys crazy is like your job description.
BUFFY
  (suddenly offended) You're asking my sister to the dance, and she's your second 
  choice?
  Behind Mike, Principal Wood and the security guard open a locker and lots 
    of coins fall out onto the hall floor. Buffy notices the commotion.
BUFFY
  (to Mike) I'll be keeping an eye on you.
  Buffy goes to the locker to check out the coins with the Principal and the 
    security guard.
PRINCIPAL
  Seems like someone's got quite a coin collection, huh?

  Yeah, why?

BUFFY
  Do you know why I came back to Sunnydale High?
BOY
  To creep me out?
BUFFY
    To help. I'm a counselor here because I wanna help. I know what it's like 
    to walk these halls and feel lost, alone. I just want to make things better, 
    connect. (stands and intimidates) And I'm going to connect with your face 
    if you don't stop wasting my time and help me do my job.
BOY
  I... please, I—

  Oh, don't worry about it, I'm going to my Mom's. It's kinda far.
DAWN
  Far is good.

CASSIE
  Buffy told you about me, right? She told you to pretend to be my friend?
DAWN
  No. (beat) Maybe. Cassie, she was scared. She wanted to help you.
CASSIE
  Well, she can't.
DAWN
  Maybe she can. She's not like you think. She's got powers... of helping. And 
  look, she was worried and now I'm worried and I wasn't pretending at all. I 
  really wanted to be your friend.
CASSIE
  (chuckles) You are my friend. 
DAWN
  I am?
CASSIE
  Yeah. Just remember, I'm not as dumb as I look.
DAWN

  A guy, the confident boy who went to Buffy's office earlier, calls out to 
    Dawn.
  CONFIDENT BOY
  Hey, Summers!
CASSIE

  PETER/CONFIDENT BOY
  I was just wondering if anyone had asked you to winter formal.
DAWN

PETER
  Well, uh, I was just doing a poll. (laughs at her) I'll see you.

  Peter goes to light a nearby torch with his candle. He pushes his hood back.
PETER
    Then we begin. (someone giggles) Mandel, shut up.
  MANDEL
    Sorry, dude, it's— It's just so cool, I mean— We're gonna be rich!
PETER
  Keep your shorts, all right. We have to do the ritual if we wanna score. Oh, 
  Keith, did you take care of the fire exits?
  KEITH
  Yeah. Anybody tries to bust in here's gonna get a nasty surprise. (chuckling) 
  I set up this booby trap my cousin Ben always used to do—
PETER
  Then nobody is getting in... (pulls a blindfolded, bound and gagged Cassie from 
  behind a bookshelf and into the circle) and nobody is getting out.
  MANDEL
  Dude.
  Cassie's whimpering through the duct tape on her mouth.
PETER
  (pulls off Cassie's blindfold) This is our sacrifice. (picks up a large cleaver) 
  It's nothing personal. It's just that you have this death-kick suicidal vibe 
  going. I figure if you disappear, everybody'll just assume you threw yourself 
  in a river somewhere. Extinguish.
  All the robed people holding candles lick their fingers and press them to 
    the candlewick to extinguish the flames.
PETER
  All mighty Avilas... please accept our sacrifice. Please appear before us, oh 
  mighty soldier of the dark. Please appear before us, and grant us with infinite 
  riches, and we will pay you with our sacrifice. We kneel before you with the 
  gift of flesh.
  One of the robed people stands and unfastens the robe, revealing her identity 
    as Buffy.
BUFFY
  OK, that—is going on your permanent record.
PETER
  (stands) Wait, this is—the counselor! What the hell is she doing here?
  MANDEL
  (pointing at another member) I-it was his idea!
  Buffy and Peter start to circle each other. Peter is still holding the cleaver.
PETER
  Back off. Get back! Get back, you stupid bitch!
  Buffy kicks him in the face, and he falls back. He gets back up and yells, 
    coming at her with a cleaver.
PETER
  Aw, you're gonna die!
  Buffy kicks him again, in the crotch this time, and he falls down in agony, 
    dropping the cleaver.
BUFFY
  Do you know how lame this is? Bored teenage boys trying to raise up a demon. 
  Sorry it didn't show. I bet it's 'cause you forgot the boom box playing some 
  heavy metal thing, like Blue Clam Cult. I think that's the key to the raising 
  of lame demons.
PETER
    (still on the floor, he looks over Buffy's shoulder and points) That lame 
    demon?
  Buffy looks behind her and sees the demon Avilas standing there. He's six 
    feet tall with a curved horn coming out of either side of his head. He's got 
    scaly brown demon skin, very muscular, with fins jutting out from his shoulders. 
    He's also got a circular cavity where his abdomen should be.

    Buffy grabs the cleaver from the floor in front of Peter and hurls it at the 
    demon. It lands in his chest, but doesn't phase the demon at all. Buffy lunges 
    at it to attack it, but it throws her across the room.
  KEVIN
  (to Peter) Dude, help!
  The demon takes the cleaver out of its chest and throws it back on the floor 
    near Peter. The demon goes after Buffy, who tries to kick him away. Peter 
    grabs the cleaver and goes after Cassie. 
BUFFY
  No!
  Peter holds the cleaver to Cassie, bending her head back to bare her neck. 
    Buffy kicks one of the cult members out of the way, and the demon attacks 
    her again, throwing her into a bookcase. While Buffy's down on the floor, 
    the demon steps on her chest.
  BUFFY
    No! Ow!
  The demon is going to hurt Buffy when it turns around instead to measure 
    a new threat. Spike (with normal, slicked back hair) is standing behind him 
    with the torch to the demon's back. It roars.
  BUFFY
    Spike?
  SPIKE
    Here to help. No hurting the girl.
  BUFFY
    Untie her. I'll take care of this. 
  Buffy takes the torch from Spike and points it at the demon. Spike walks 
    to Cassie. Buffy sweeps the torch in front of the demon's face. Spike punches 
    Peter, knocking him to the ground. Buffy jabs the torch into the demon's abdomen 
    cavity. Spike's on top of Peter, pummeling him ferociously. After each punch, 
    Spike pauses to hold his aching head, then he punches Peter again.
PETER
  Who are you?
SPIKE
  I'm a bad man.
  After knocking Peter out, Spike grabs the cleaver and holds it menacingly 
    over Peter while he stands. The demon has caught on fire from Buffy's torching 
    it. Spike uses the cleaver gently to cut the ties on Cassie's hands, then 
    he takes off the duct tape on her mouth. The demon has burned to a crisp. 
    Cassie's crying, but calms down enough to tell Spike something.
CASSIE
  She'll tell you. Someday she'll tell you.
  Spike stares at Cassie, taken aback. Buffy comes over to them, and attends 
    to Cassie.
BUFFY
  Are you OK?
  Spike gets up and walks off, while Buffy inspects Cassie's arm. Cassie winces.
CASSIE
  Uh-huh. Ow.
PETER
  (crawling on the floor toward the crispy demon) You can't be dead. Where are 
  my infinite riches? (the crispy demon jumps up and bites his shoulder) Ahh! 
  Ahh! It bit me!
  The demon explodes. Buffy shields Cassie, who gasps with fright.
BUFFY
  (to Cassie) C'mon.
PETER
  Help! Help me, please! I'm bleeding.
BUFFY
  (walking away) Sorry. My office hours are 10 to 4.

BUFFY
  It's all OK now. I hope you're not too disappointed.
  They walk to the main door, and when Buffy opens it, the booby trap triggers 
    a crossbow to shoot an arrow at their heads. Buffy reaches up in time to stop 
    it from hitting Cassie between the eyes. 
BUFFY
  See? (breaks the arrow in half) You can make a difference.
  Cassie reaches up admiringly to push a strand of hair out of Buffy's face.
CASSIE
  And you will. 
  Cassie breathes in sharply and collapses onto the floor. Buffy kneels down 
    to help her. She puts her ear to Cassie's chest, then checks her pulse, and 
    strokes her hair.

WILLOW
  How is her mom?
BUFFY
  OK. (beat) As OK as... she told me that her family had a history of heart irregularities, 
  but she never told Cassie.
WILLOW
  Cassie didn't know? Then it was fate?
XANDER
  I think she was gonna die, no matter what, wasn't she. Didn't matter what you 
  did.
BUFFY
  She just knew. She was special. I failed her.
DAWN
  (crying) Uh-uh. No. You didn't, 'cause you tried. You listened, and you tried. 
  She died 'cause of her heart, not 'cause of you. She was my friend because of 
  you. I guess sometimes you can't help.
