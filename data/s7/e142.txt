  RECAP: (Skip Recap...)

  GILES (V.O.)
    Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
  1     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    HOUSE - NIGHT
    Buffy, Faith, and Spike walk into Buffy's house through the front door. Dawn 
    and Giles are at the dining room table.
  FAITH

    Hey, got a spare bed for a wanted fugitive?
  GILES
    (stands, nods) Hello, Faith.
  Cut to:
  2     EXT.     FOREST 
    - NIGHT

    Buffy and Faith are following a Bringer, chatting as they go.
  FAITH
    You got a rough sitch here, trying to turn a bunch of little girls into an 
    army...
  
    Cut to:
    2a     EXT.     BACKYARD 
      AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY

      Pan out to show that the potential slayers are training in the backyard, 
      being led by Kennedy.
    POTENTIALS
      Huh!
  
  Cut to:
  BUFFY

    They're potential slayers, just like we were. 
  Cut to:
  3     INT.     TRUCK 
    - NIGHT
    The young girl is panting, catching her breath. She's sitting in the passenger's 
    seat in an old truck beside a man dressed as a preacher or priest.
  CALEB

    (wearing a black shirt with priest's collar, speaking in a southern drawl) 
    Call me Caleb. 
  Cut to:
  4     INT.     WINE 
    CELLAR AT THE SHADOW VALLEY VINEYARDS - NIGHT
    Buffy walks down the steps into the wine cellar.
  BUFFY

    I heard you have something of mine.
  CALEB
    (chuckles) I do now. (with one powerful punch, he sends Buffy flying across 
    the room)
  A potential with long black hair swings at Caleb, but he grabs her sword, 
    then her face. Caleb snaps the potential's neck and drops her to the ground.
  MOLLY
    (seeing Caleb kill the potential) No...!

  Caleb walks menacingly toward Molly, who backs up slowly, frozen with 
    fear. She raises her arm back to stab him, but he grabs her wrist, then her 
    neck. Caleb squeezes Molly's neck, lifting her off the floor. 
  CALEB
    (to Molly) I work in mysterious ways. (stabs Molly, lets go of her neck, dropping 
    her to the ground)
  Caleb grabs Xander and turns him around so he's facing Caleb. Caleb plunges 
    his thumb into Xander's left eye, gouging it out. Xander screams in agony. 
    Xander, bleeding from his eye, stumbles back, falling to the ground in front 
    of wine barrels.
  BUFFY
    Xander! 

  Cut to:
  5     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Anya's talking to the gang.
  ANYA
    Look, I'm not saying it's a happy scenario, but we're dealing with a Big Bad 
    that can be any dead person it wants.

  Cut to:
  6     INT.     WINE 
    CELLAR AT THE SHADOW VALLEY VINEYARDS - NIGHT
    Caleb is talking to the First who has taken Buffy's form.
  CALEB
    (reaches toward her) At long last. (tries to touch her face, but his hand 
    goes through her head) 

  BUFFY/FIRST
    The slayer.
  Cut to:
  7     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Buffy addresses the meeting of Giles, Dawn, Faith, Willow, Xander, Robin Wood 
    and all the potentials in her living room. Xander is sitting in an overstuffed 
    chair, with Dawn sitting beside him on the arm of the chair. Kennedy is sitting 
    on the sofa, with Willow sitting beside her on the arm of the sofa. Anya is 
    standing beside Willow with her arms crossed.

  BUFFY
    We've spent all this time worrying about the seal and the hellmouth. The bad 
    guys always go where the power is. They're protecting the vineyard or something 
    at the vineyard. And I say it's time we go in and take it away from them.
  FAITH
    (standing beside Robin Wood with her arms crossed) How 'bout...we don't? 
  GILES
    This is a hell of a lot to ask.

  BUFFY
    And now, what? Suddenly you're all acting like you can't trust me?
  DAWN
    (stands, walks up to Buffy, softly) We have to be together on this. You can't 
    be a part of it. (Buffy blinks her eyes in disbelief) So I need you to leave. 
  
  Cut to:
  8     EXT.     FRONT 
    PORCH AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

    Faith follows Buffy outside.
  FAITH
    (concerned) Look, I swear I didn't want it to go this way—
  BUFFY
    (sternly) Don't.
  BUFFY

    (Buffy's face is wet with tears) Whether you wanted it or not, their lives 
    are yours.
  Fade to black.

    The Start Of Episode

  
  PROLOGUE:
  9     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    The SITs, Giles, and the Scooby gang—minus Buffy, Spike, and Andrew—are 
    sitting together in the living room having a very disorganized discussion. 
    Everyone is talking over everyone else.
  GILES

    Power to the people? You sound like a child of the seventies.
  KENNEDY
    What we're saying is we're in charge in charge of ourselves.
  FAITH
    OK, you guys, let's just try not to freak out.
  KENNEDY

    All I'm saying is now that Buffy's not here, we finally have some say in how 
    and when we lose our necks.
  ROBIN
    Maybe you don't have to be so blunt about (gestures a cutting motion with 
    his hand in front of his neck) the losing of the necks bit.
  ANYA
    (emphatically) No, let the girl speak the truth. We're all on death's door 
    repeatedly ringing the doorbell like maniacal girl scouts trying to make quota.
  XANDER

    (shifts in his seat) You know, I'm thinking that everyone here shouldn't have 
    a say.
  GILES
    We just have to find some way of having constructive dialogue without going 
    completely mad.
  AMANDA
    Do you know the parliamentary procedure? 'Cause that's a convenient way of 
    organizing—
  KENNEDY

    I just wonder if those of us who have been here longer should have more of 
    a say.
  ROBIN
    Maybe we should break down into small groups so it wouldn't be so chaotic. 
    Faith, what do you think?
  AMANDA
    When I was involved with the Model UN, we found the parliamentary procedure 
    to be a total lifesaver. For example, once when I was Uruguay—anyway, 
    one of those "U" countries—it was like here, only we had this 
    system which allowed us to organize our conversation.

  While Amanda is talking, Giles whispers to Dawn.
  GILES
    (to Dawn) She's going to be fine. Really, it's for the best.
  DAWN
    (to Giles) Yeah? Then why do I feel like this?
  FAITH

    (to the group) I hear what you're saying, but—
  KENNEDY
    Shouldn't we get down to business?
  WILLOW
    (rolls her eyes) You guys, I think we're wasting time arguing about how to 
    argue.
  AMANDA

    Well, why don't we—?
  VI
    (to Amanda) Please do not mention parliamentary procedure.
  CARIDAD
    (under her breath) I second that. 
  FAITH

    Everyone, listen to me. Chill. All right? It's been a long night, and I don't 
    know about you, but I'm wiped. Maybe we should catch some sleep and figure 
    all this out in the morning.
  KENNEDY
    Do we really have time to waste?
  FAITH
    Look, I understand you guys are wicked stressed. Frankly, our situation blows. 
    We've got to stay cool. That's the only way we're going to get through this. 
    Can everyone handle that?
  VI

    Yeah...yeah...we'll get some rest and then tomorrow, things won't seem so—
  The lights go out in the house, and everyone jumps and gasps, frightened, 
    asking what happened.
  CARIDAD
    The lights went out?
  AMANDA
    I'll get some candles... if we have candles.

  KENNEDY
    I'll check the fuse box.
  FAITH
    (looking out the window) Don't bother. All the lights on the whole street 
    just went out.
  KENNEDY
    Which means?

  FAITH
    (looking at the group) That the people from the power company have got the 
    hell out of Sunnydale.
  VI
    I think I'm freaking out.
  Cut to:
  10     EXT.     NEIGHBORHOOD 
    STREET - NIGHT

    The neighborhood is abandoned except for the last family putting their necessities 
    in the minivan. Buffy walks down the street by herself, with her arms crossed. 
    She sees a house and walks up to it.
  Cut to:
  11     INT.     STRANGER'S 
    HOUSE - NIGHT
    Buffy walks into the house and looks around. A man comes up to her from within 
    the house and points a shotgun in her face.
  MAN

    Don't move. Get out of my house.
  BUFFY
    Hey. (takes the shotgun away from the man, sighs) I thought the place would 
    be empty. I was looking for a place to crash. You know, you really should 
    leave.
  MAN
    (indignant)You can't just kick me out of my own house.
  BUFFY

    (shrugs) Why not? It's what all the cool kids are doing nowadays. (walks into 
    the kitchen) This is not your house. It's not your town. Not anymore. (opens 
    the refrigerator) Got any Tab?
  Cut to:
  Opening Credits.
  ACT I:
  12     INT.     MISSION 
    - DAY

    Andrew and Spike are waiting inside the candlelit interior room of the mission. 
    Andrew is lying on the floor on his belly, leaning up on his elbows, propping 
    his head up on his hand, and swinging his feet together like a little boy. 
    Spike is sitting on the floor, leaning against the wall with his knees bent 
    up, and his arms resting on his knees.
  ANDREW
    (rhythmically) I spy with my little eye something that begins with a "T."
  SPIKE
    (rolls his eyes) Tapestry.
  ANDREW

    (smiles) Hey, good one. How did you—
  SPIKE
    Tapestry's the only thing in the whole bloody room.
  ANDREW
    Ah...so say you, but I say look deeper. (rolls over onto his back, looks at 
    the ceiling)
  SPIKE

    I'll look deep into your jugular is what I'll look at.
  ANDREW
    Don't spazz out. 
  SPIKE
    I'm not— (glares at Andrew) Don't say another word.

  ANDREW
    (rolls back on his belly, looks at Spike excitedly) Rock, paper, scissors? 
  
  SPIKE
    What's the matter with you? Don't you understand what's happening?
  ANDREW
    Uh...yeah. We're waiting here till it's night again so you can ride on your 
    motorcycle without exploding. 

  SPIKE
    And every minute we're stuck here, the slayer's out there facing hell knows 
    what.
  ANDREW
    Come on. What's the worst thing that could happen to her?
  Spike glares at Andrew.
  Cut to:

  13     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    The potentials and scoobies and Dawn, Giles and Faith are down in the basement 
    having another meeting by candlelight. Anya, Xander and Dawn are sitting at 
    a table. The others are gathered around. 
  FAITH
    All right. So, what do we know?
  XANDER

    Well, we know we're basically the last humans left in Sunnydale.
  CARIDAD
    And that all the evil in town wants us dead.
  VI
    I don't want to die.
  ANYA

    Don't worry. It's far more likely you'll live long enough to watch most of 
    your friends die first. (looks at Vi) And then you'll die.
  KENNEDY
    We also know that Caleb told Buffy that everything's going down at the seal. 
    I think we should head—
  FAITH
    (cuts her off) Let's not get ahead of ourselves. So, we know we've got a lot 
    of enemies. We'll start there.
  KENNEDY

    Faith, I'm sorry—
  FAITH
    (cuts her off again) I got this, OK? So let's go over our rogues' gallery. 
    Who exactly do we have here?
  DAWN
    Well, there's the First, who we can't touch.
  XANDER

    Then there's our friend the reverend I-hate-women.
  ANYA
    Who's basically untouchable.
  DAWN
    There's the 'roid-rage vamps, who are pretty much the worst. And the—
  FAITH

    Bringers...I think they're our weakest link.
  GILES
    Are you thinking of attacking the Bringers?
  FAITH
    Maybe, or... OK, we could kidnap one.
  KENNEDY

    (nastily) And what? Hold it ransom?
  XANDER
    (sarcastically) Yeah, I'll get the magazines and start ripping out the letters 
    now. "Dear Mr. First, if you want your Bringer back... well, we'll be 
    surprised because you got, like, 3 million of them. So please disregard this 
    letter. Yours sincerely—"
  FAITH
    I'm saying we think about getting us a Bringer and making it talk. Find out 
    info on the first and Caleb that way.
  ROBIN

    How do you think we should catch one if they don't want to be found?
  KENNEDY
    OK, I'm not sure this is such a good idea. Why try and get information when 
    we already know about the seal? Why don't we send a team to the high school? 
    Do some recon and—
  FAITH
    No.
  KENNEDY

    (sits back, raises eyebrows) Just like that? You're not even listening.
  WILLOW
    (softly, to Kennedy) Sweetie, you're pushing too hard.
  KENNEDY
    I thought things would be different now, but you keep shutting me down.
  FAITH

    Things are different, because now... (stands) I'm your boss. Look, you guys, 
    I'm not Buffy. I'm not the one who's been on your asses all this time, but 
    I'm not one of you anymore, either. I'm your leader, which means I go first, 
    and I make the rules, and the rest of you follow after me. Is that clear? 
    So, Kennedy, (points) back the hell off, and let me do my job, all right? 
    (calmly) OK, let's get down to business.
  Cut to:
  14     INT.     WINE 
    CELLAR AT THE SHADOW VALLEY VINEYARDS - NIGHT
    Bringers are using welding torches and pick-axes on some stone in a cave under 
    the vineyard. Buffy/First and Caleb look on.
  BUFFY/FIRST

    I was hoping you'd bring me some better news.
  CALEB
    And I wish I had some.
  BUFFY/FIRST
    Is this going to do anything? Or is all of this just to make the Bringers 
    sweat? Do the Bringers sweat?
  CALEB

    Actually, I think they pant, like dogs. And I don't know if this is going 
    to do any good, but we have to try everything.
  BUFFY/FIRST
    You realize what will happen if the slayer and her girls get it, don't you?
  CALEB
    They won't.
  BUFFY/FIRST

    (looks at Caleb) That's right. They won't. (walks away) Because you're going 
    to kill all of them and everyone they know.
  CALEB
    Hallelujah.
  Cut to:
  15     EXT.     ALLEY 
    - NIGHT

    Kennedy walks down the alley alone, looking at the ground and pouting. A Bringer 
    comes up behind her wielding a knife, but someone lassos him around the neck 
    and pulls him to the ground. It's Giles. Giles ties up the Bringer as the 
    other potential slayers go to Kennedy's aid, fighting off the other Bringers 
    that have shown up, using the Bringers' knives against them.
  KENNEDY
    (stands after killing a Bringer, panting) I've never been the bait before. 
    That was, uh... actually, kind of scary.
  CARIDAD
    We had your back.
  GILES

    (tying up a Bringer) You did well. Your performance as a disgruntled minion 
    was spot on.
  KENNEDY
    I'm method. (smiles) Let's get this back to the captain.
  Fade to black.
  ACT II:
  16     INT.     KITCHEN 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DUSK

    Giles and a few others come up from the basement to talk to the gang assembled 
    in the kitchen.
  DAWN
    (sees Giles) Oh, hey. So?
  GILES
    Uh, the Bringer's dumb. (puts on his glasses)
  ANYA

    You were expecting, what, a Rhodes Scholar?
  GILES
    Dumb as in mute.
  FAITH
    Someone ripped out its tongue.
  AMANDA

    Oh, gross.
  DAWN
    Hey...I've been reading this old Turkish spell book. There's an old conjuration 
    that the ancient Turks used to communicate with the dying.
  WILLOW
    Oh, yeah. I think I've read a translation of it.
  DAWN

    (wide-eyed) There's a translation of it?! (sighs) I'm over it. Um, so the 
    spell is used to communicate with people who can't talk. Um, like if a person 
    was dying, this spell would let them say their good-byes or, you know, gripe 
    about how nobody came to visit them. Would this help us with Mr. No-Tongue?
  WILLOW
    Yeah, I think so. I just need to get together a few ingredients.
  FAITH
    All right. Well, cool. While Willow does that, the rest of us can—
  ANDREW (O.S.)

    We're back!
  Spike walks into the room.
  GILES
    Spike.
  SPIKE
    Hey.

  ANDREW
    (walks into the room, puts his helmet on a shelf) Hi, everybody. I missed 
    you guys a lot. Sorry it took so long to get back from our mission-mission, 
    but we had to wait out the sun. Well, I think our mission went very well. 
    We, uh, we rode on Spike's hog, which was very cool, and, uh... uh, played 
    some amusing games, and—oh! We got some new information. You know what? 
    I really need to urinate. (walks out of the room)
  SPIKE
    He's a breath of fresh air, isn't he? Thank god I don't breathe. So, I think 
    we got a lead. Where's Buffy?
  DAWN
    Um... (looks away) she's not here right now.

  SPIKE
    When's she get back?
  WILLOW
    (walks toward Spike, wringing her hands, nervously) Uh...while you were gone, 
    we all got together and t-talked out some disagreements that we were having. 
    Um... and eventually, after much discussion, Buffy decided that it would be 
    best for all of us if she took a little time off, a little breather.
  SPIKE
    (stares in disbelief) Uh-huh. I see. Been practicing that little speech long, 
    have you? (Willow looks hurt and walks away) So, uh, Buffy took some time 
    off right in the middle of the apocalypse, and it was her decision?

  XANDER
    Well, we all decided.
  SPIKE
    Oh, yeah. You all decided. (chuckles) You sad, sad, ungrateful traitors. Who 
    do you think you are?
  WILLOW
    We're her friends. We just want—

  SPIKE
    Oh, that's ballsy of you. You're her friends, and you betray her like this?
  GILES
    You don't understand—
  SPIKE
    You know, I think I do... (disdainfully) Rupert. You used to be the big man, 
    didn't you? The teacher all full of wisdom. Now she's surpassed you, and you 
    can't handle it. She has saved your lives again and again. (the others roll 
    their eyes and avoid eye contact with Spike) She's died for you. And this 
    is how you thank—

  FAITH
    Hey. Why don't you take it down a notch or two? The time for speech-giving 
    is over, bat boy.
  SPIKE
    (crosses his arms) Oh, is that right?
  FAITH
    Yeah, that's right. Save your lack of breath.

  SPIKE
    (shrugs) All right. (punches Faith) 
  FAITH
    You're pretty sweet on her, aren't you? (kicks Spike in the face) I think 
    it's cute. (Spike punches Faith; she punches him back) They way she's got 
    you whipped. (kicks Spike into the other room where he slides over the dining 
    room table and onto the floor)
  GILES
    Enough!

  Faith goes into the dining room after Spike and starts punching him in 
    the face repeatedly. He kicks her off of him and leaps to his feet. 
  SPIKE
    Finally got what you wanted, didn't you? (exchanges punches with Faith) Where 
    is she?
  FAITH
    I don't know.
  Spike rolls Faith over his back and flings her into the dining room wall 
    pretty hard. She gets to her feet as does Spike, and they stare at each other 
    for a moment before Spike finally walks out the front door. All the others 
    are standing in the doorway watching the fight.

  Cut to:
  17     EXT.     IN FRONT 
    OF BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Spike walks out the front door and down the path toward the street. He pauses, 
    shuts his eyes, and smells purposefully. Finally he catches the scent he's 
    looking for and walks down the street. 
  Cut to:
  18     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

    A Bringer is chained to the basement wall as Willow does a spell in another 
    language. Giles, Kennedy, Xander, and Andrew are there as well. 
  WILLOW
    (holding a book open in her hands) Speak to us.
  ANDREW
    Maybe I should rough him up a little.
  XANDER

    (to Andrew) Andrew!
  KENNEDY
    (to Andrew) Quiet!
  WILLOW
    I don't know, guys. That should have worked. (Giles and Willow stare at the 
    Bringer)
  ANDREW

    (not sounding like himself, but soft and monotonous) I am a drone in the mind 
    that is evil.
  XANDER
    (to Andrew) Could you just shut up?
  ANDREW
    (not sounding like himself, but soft and monotonous) I say I'm part of the 
    great darkness.
  KENNEDY

    (rolls her eyes) Somebody needs a reality check.
  XANDER
    Or a muzzle.
  GILES
    (looks at Andrew) Wait.
  ANDREW

    (speaking for the Bringer) I'm only a fragment of the we. We work as one to 
    serve the First.
  Xander and Kennedy stand and back away from the table where Andrew is 
    sitting. Giles and Willow stand as well, and they all stare at Andrew.
  WILLOW
    OK, what do you—the we—do for the First?
  ANDREW

    (speaking for the Bringer) We work to prepare for the inevitable battle.
  KENNEDY
    (grabs the Bringer's knife off the table and holds it to the Bringer's throat) 
    How? Tell me exactly what the Bringers are doing.
  GILES
    Kennedy, he can't see the knife. 
  ANDREW

    (speaking for the Bringer) We can feel the knife.
  GILES
    Kennedy? (holds his hand out to her; she stands and hands him the knife)
  ANDREW
    (speaking for the Bringer) We attend to the needs of the infinite evil. We 
    exterminate girls and destroy the legacy of the slayer. We build an arsenal 
    beneath the dirt. We obey the commands of our teacher Caleb.
  XANDER

    Wait. Could we go back to the dirt thing?
  ANDREW
    (speaking for the Bringer) We build weapons to prepare for the coming war... 
    at the farthest edge of town. We are everywhere. We are like the ocean's waves. 
    We watch your efforts and are not scared. We will laugh at you as you die.
  Giles takes the Bringer's knife and slits the Bringer's throat with it. 
    The Bringer goes limp.
  ANDREW
    (himself again, stands, upset) What the bananas?! You are so lucky that you 
    did not just... magically decapitate me.

  GILES
    We've got enough here. We need to get Faith in on this. Xander, gather some 
    maps. We need to find a subterranean space large enough to house an armory.
  Everyone else leaves the room and goes upstairs. 
  ANDREW
    (following after everyone) I feel used and violated, and... (holds his throat) 
    I need a lozenge.

  19     INT.     STRANGER'S 
    HOUSE - NIGHT
    Buffy's sleeping on the bed when there's a knock at the door. A few moments 
    later, Spike walks up to the room where she's sleeping.
  SPIKE
    (standing in the doorway) There you are. Do you realize I could just walk 
    in here, no invite needed? This town really is theirs now, isn't it? (walks 
    up to Buffy) I heard. I was over there. That bitch. (sighs) She's all about 
    smiles and reformation when you're on your feet, but the moment you're down, 
    she's all about the kicking, isn't that right? Makes me want—
  BUFFY

    (softly, staring off into the corner) It wasn't just Faith. It was all of 
    them. (looks at Spike) And it's not like they were wrong. Please leave.
  SPIKE
    No. (excited) This'll change your tune. I came here 'cause I got something 
    to tell you. You were right. Caleb is trying to protect something from you. 
    And I think you were spot on all the way. I think it's at the vineyard. So? 
    You were right. (she still hasn't moved or reacted) Buffy?
  BUFFY
    I don't feel very right.
  SPIKE

    (walks closer to her) You're not fooling me.
  BUFFY
    What do you even mean?
  SPIKE
    Well, you're not a quitter.
  BUFFY

    Watch me.
  SPIKE
    You were their leader, and you still are. This isn't something you gave up, 
    it's something they took.
  BUFFY
    (looks at him) And the difference is?
  SPIKE

    We can take it back.

    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Faith and Giles are looking at a map. 
  FAITH

    Sewer tunnel on the north side's closest, so guess we'll start there.
  GILES
    Sounds fine. What time shall I tell everyone? 
  FAITH
    How about around 7:00? (beat) 7:00 sharp. So, tomorrow we fight.
  GILES

    Tomorrow. Good night, Faith. (starts to walk away, then turns to her) Faith.
  FAITH
    Yeah?
  GILES
    You're doing just fine. (walks away) 
  Faith starts to walk toward the bed but looks up to see the Mayor (from 
    Season 3) standing there in front of her.

  MAYOR/FIRST
    I'd say better than fine. I'd say you're doing a bang-up job. 
  FAITH
    Get out.
  MAYOR/FIRST
    (laughs) Well, gosh. (smiles) I think, you know, a "hello" or a 
    "nice to see you" might be a little more welcome. It's the end of 
    humanity, Faith, (shakes his head) not the end of courtesy.

  FAITH
    You're wasting your time. I know who you are, what you are.
  MAYOR/FIRST
    (nods) Yeah. Yeah. (looks at Faith) Nobody's explained to you how this works, 
    have they? (paces) You see... I am part of the First, as you kids call it, 
    but I'm also me, Richard Wilkins III, late mayor and founder of Sunnydale. 
    Here. I'll prove it to you. Ask me a question only I know the answer to. Something 
    like... (laughs) Where did I hide the moon pies in my office? Or... who was 
    my favorite character in little women? Meg. (laughs) I know. I know. Most 
    people guess Beth, but Meg, she's such a proper young lady. Remember when 
    Jo burned her hair?
  FAITH
    (looks in his face) I know what you're doing, and it's not going to work. 
    (walks away) But feel free to keep talking, 'cause, hell, I could listen to 
    you yap all night.

  MAYOR/FIRST
    Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Language! You're a leader now. You keep throwing 
    the "h-e-double hockey sticks" around, pretty soon, the girls are 
    going to pick up on it. Then what?
  FAITH
    (nods) You let me worry about the girls.
  MAYOR/FIRST

    Of course. Of course. You're doing a great job with them, by the way. Much 
    better than Buffy ever did. You were smart to kick her out. 
  FAITH
    (shakes her head) That's not what we— (the Mayor looks at her, raises 
    his eyebrows in disbelief) Buffy got them this far.
  MAYOR/FIRST
    Why are you protecting her? You think she cares about you? She nearly killed 
    you, Faith.

  FAITH
    It's different now.
  MAYOR/FIRST
    (walks up to Faith) No matter what you do, Buffy will always see you as a 
    killer, not as a person. And now you have what she so desperately wants: the 
    respect of these girls. All she needs is an excuse, and she'll finish what 
    she started when she stuck that knife in your belly. You stay on guard, Faith. 
    Buffy's dangerous. If you're not careful, she'll destroy you. (shrugs) I'm 
    just saying.
  Fade to black.
  ACT III:

  21     INT.     STRANGER'S 
    HOUSE - NIGHT
    Buffy is sitting on the edge of the bed. Spike is standing up in front of 
    her.
  SPIKE
    No?
  BUFFY

    No.
  SPIKE
    You mean no as in eventually?
  BUFFY
    You really have problems with that word, don't you?
  SPIKE

    You can get them back.
  BUFFY
    Can, maybe. Should? (sighs, holds her head in her hands) I'm just so tired.
  SPIKE
    They need you.
  BUFFY

    Well, I...
  SPIKE
    It's bloody chaos over there without you.
  BUFFY
    It is?
  SPIKE

    Yeah! Yeah, it's, uh... There's junk... You know? Food cartons, sleeping bags 
    not rolled up, everyone's very scared and, uh, unkempt.
  BUFFY
    (smirks) Sounds dire.
  SPIKE
    I didn't see a lot. (sits on the edge of the bed beside her) I came, hit Faith 
    a bunch of times, and left.
  BUFFY

    Really? I mean, not that I'm glad, but—
  SPIKE
    Oh, you say the word, and she's a footnote in history. I'll make it look like 
    a painful accident.
  BUFFY
    That's my problem. I say the word, some girl dies...every time.
  SPIKE

    There's always casualties in war.
  BUFFY
    Casualties. It just sounds so...casual. These are girls that I got killed. 
    I cut myself off from them...all of them. I knew I was gonna lose some of 
    them and I didn't— (shakes her head, stands up) You know what? I'm still 
    making excuses. I've always cut myself off. I've always— (sighs) Being 
    the slayer made me different. But it's my fault I stayed that way. People 
    are always trying to connect to me, and I just slip away. (chuckles) You should 
    know.
  SPIKE
    I seem to recall a certain amount of connecting.

  BUFFY
    (shakes her head) Oh, please! We were never close. You just wanted me because 
    I was...unattainable.
  SPIKE
    (stands, angrily) You think that's all that was?
  BUFFY
    Please, let's not go over the past. (sits)

  SPIKE
    Oh, no, no. Let's hold on here. I'm hummed along to your pity-ditty, and I 
    think I should have the mic for a bit.
  BUFFY
    Fine. The stage is yours. Cheer me up.
  SPIKE
    You're insufferable.

  BUFFY
    Thank you. That really helped.
  SPIKE
    I'm not trying to cheer you up.
  BUFFY
    What are you trying to say?

  SPIKE
    I don't know. I'll know when I'm done saying it. Something pissed me off, 
    and I just— "Unattainable." That's it.
  BUFFY
    Fine. I'm attainable. I'm an attain-a-thon. May I please just go to sleep?
  SPIKE

    You listen to me. (kneels in front of her) I've been alive a bit longer than 
    you, and dead a lot longer than that. I've seen things you couldn't imagine, 
    and done things I prefer you didn't. I don't exactly have a reputation for 
    being a thinker. I follow my blood, which doesn't exactly rush in the direction 
    of my brain. So I make a lot of mistakes, a lot of wrong bloody calls. (looks 
    into her eyes) A 100+ years, and there's only one thing I've ever been sure 
    of: you. (Buffy looks away; he reaches toward her face) Hey, look at me. I'm 
    not asking you for anything. When I say, "I love you," it's not 
    because I want you or because I can't have you. It has nothing to do with 
    me. (a tear rolls down Buffy's cheek) I love what you are, what you do, how 
    you try. I've seen your kindness and your strength. I've seen the best and 
    the worst of you. And I understand with perfect clarity exactly what you are. 
    You're a hell of a woman. You're the one, Buffy.
  BUFFY
    (quietly) I don't wanna be the one.
  SPIKE
    I don't wanna be this good looking and athletic. We all have crosses to bear. 
    (Buffy chuckles) You get some rest now. I'll check in before first light. 
    You can decide how you want... (walks toward the door)

  BUFFY
    Spike? (he turns to face her) Could you...stay here?
  SPIKE
    Sure. (looks at a chair) That diabolical old torture device, the comfy chair. 
    (takes off his coat) It'll do me fine.
  BUFFY
    No, I mean...here. (touches the bed beside her) Will you just hold me?

  Spike sits on the bed beside Buffy and puts his arm around her. She curls 
    up on him, cuddling up to his chest as he puts his arm around her shoulder, 
    holding her head with his hand.
  Cut to:
  22     INT.     BUFFY'S

    The Mayor/First is talking to Faith.
  MAYOR/FIRST

    Deep down, you always wanted Buffy to accept you, to love you even. Why do 
    you think that is?
  FAITH
    You a shrink now?
  MAYOR/FIRST
    (pacing) You keep looking for love and acceptance from these people, these 
    friends of yours, but you're never gonna find it. The truth is, nobody will 
    ever love you. Not the way I love you.
  FAITH

    Get out.
  MAYOR/FIRST
    They'll forever see you as a killer.
  FAITH
    I said get out.
  MAYOR/FIRST

    I'll always be with you, firecracker, in everything you do. (disappears in 
    a flash of light)
  ROBIN
    (touches Faith's shoulder) Faith?
  FAITH
    (startled) You shouldn't sneak up like that! I almost took your head off!
  ROBIN

    Sorry, I knocked.
  FAITH
    Who—what'd you see?
  ROBIN
    Just—you're looking spooked. What happened? Are you sure you're all right?

  FAITH
    Oh, what? You wanna rap about my problems now? Are you looking to be the guy 
    who puts the "pal" in principal for me?
  ROBIN
    OK, you know what? I came up here to talk to you about weapons.
  FAITH

    (shakes head) Sorry. I don't know what I'm doing. (turns around) I'm just—
  ROBIN
    Listen, I'm gonna leave you alone. I didn't mean to intrude. (starts to walk 
    away)
  FAITH
    It was the First.
  ROBIN

    (walks back into the room; shuts the door) Well, you're really in the game 
    now, Faith. The First doesn't show itself unless it thinks you matter.
  FAITH
    Lucky me. I'm a player. (holds out her hand) Man, look at that. My hand's 
    shaking. Demons, vampires, women in the penitentiary system—none of that 
    freaks me out.
  ROBIN
    That's exactly what the First does—finds your Achilles' heel.

  FAITH
    Nah, it just talked to me. What? It does a heal thing too?
  ROBIN
    Um, it's a phrase. Your weak spot. 
  FAITH
    Oh, school thing. (looks away) I was kinda absent that decade. (sits on edge 
    of the bed)

  ROBIN
    (walks up to Faith, sits on the edge of the bed beside her) So, who was it? 
    The First.
  FAITH
    He was like an old boss of mine.
  ROBIN
    Just a boss, and he's got you shaking like this? Wouldn't give you a raise, 
    huh?

  FAITH
    (laughs) Yeah, right. Well, it sounds retarded, but he was like a dad to me.
  ROBIN
    Oh. It was my mother when it came to me. And I mean it was her, right down 
    to the perfume.
  FAITH
    (looks at him) Sorry. 

  ROBIN
    (nods) Yeah.
  FAITH
    I'm just so pissed off at myself. I knew it was a trick.
  ROBIN
    Yeah, so did I, but I still wanted my mother to hold me like a little baby— 
    (blinks, sits up) in a manly way, of course.

  FAITH
    Of course.
  ROBIN
    Listen, nobody wants to be alone, Faith. We all want someone who cares, to 
    be touched that way. (looks at her) I mean, the First deals in figments, but 
    that wanting is real.
  FAITH
    Hitting things and a whole lot of Jack D dulls it some.

  ROBIN
    Among other things. (they both smile)
  FAITH
    (stands) When it came to you, did the First tell the truth? 
  ROBIN
    Yeah.

  FAITH
    It said to watch out for Buffy, that Buffy's dangerous.
  ROBIN
    Well, what do you think?
  FAITH
    (paces) Could be. I mean, we've given her pretty good reason to be pissed 
    off. You know the messed up thing? The First is telling me to worry about 
    her, and I just wish she was here. In a couple hours, I'm gonna lead these 
    girls into some serious crap, and she's the only one—

  ROBIN
    (exasperated) She's not the only one. You're a slayer too, Faith, and I think 
    you're a good leader.
  FAITH
    I'm an ex-con who didn't finish high school.
  ROBIN
    Yeah, well I'm the principal of a school where nobody finished, and I am completely 
    out of my league in this.

  FAITH
    Well, I hear otherwise.
  ROBIN
    (scoffs, stands) So, um, tomorrow then?
  FAITH
    Forget about tomorrow. This is tonight. (pulls his hand toward her face) It's 
    been a while. Am I out of line?

  ROBIN
    No. You're the leader.
  Faith and Robin kiss. He lifts her up in his arms and she pushes him back 
    onto the bed. Robin starts pulling on her shirt as they make out.

  WILLOW
    OK, guys. Giles said Faith wants us to start early in the morning, so— 
    (looks around at her mostly empty room except for Kennedy on the bed) What 
    happened to the girls?
  KENNEDY
    (lying sexily across the bed wearing a slinky nightie and twirling her hair) 
    Looks like there's only one girl here.

  WILLOW
    What about the other ones with their sleeping bags and their headgear and 
    their snoring? (smiles) They're not here, are they?
  KENNEDY
    Nope.
  WILLOW
    (shuts the door) Well that's nice. (sits on the bed)

  KENNEDY
    Nice... (kissses Willow) and necessary. (puts her arm around Willow's waist) 
    Come here, you. (pushes Willow back on the bed so they're lying down beside 
    each other; they're still kissing) Foreplay was threatening to turn into twelve-play. 
    (Willow turns away) Something not right?
  WILLOW
    No. No, I just, uh, guess I'm a little scared.
  KENNEDY
    It's probably stupid to ask why, huh? Death, war, apocalypse.

  WILLOW
    Me. I'm just scared that if we... and then I'll... and then...
  KENNEDY
    And then? (chuckles, plays with Willow's hair) Isn't that the good part?
  WILLOW
    Good. Yeah, g-good feeling, but also...

  KENNEDY
    Bad stuff, like unrestrained moaning and screaming with joy?
  WILLOW
    (turns to face Kennedy) Well, sort of. The unrestrained part. But I've just—I've 
    kind of been in this space where I should be restrained. I've been controlling 
    myself and I— if I lose that control, let myself go, I could just go.
  KENNEDY

    Hm. (strokes Willow's cheek) You worried you're gonna turn into big bad Willow?
  WILLOW
    It's not stupid. When we first kissed, I turned into...Warren.
  KENNEDY
    It's not stupid, but it's not gonna happen. I just want you to know you're 
    safe with me.
  WILLOW

    Yeah?
  KENNEDY
    You can float around, and I'll tether you down. (smiles)
  WILLOW
    (smiles) You'll be like—like my kite string?
  KENNEDY

    Mm-hmm. You'll be a kite, and I'll be your kite string, OK?
  WILLOW
    (nods) OK.
  KENNEDY
    OK. (they kiss) Mmm...come here.

  XANDER

    listen to an a capella concert of people, you know, (takes a bite) moaning 
    and groaning.

  ANYA

    Disgusting is what it is.
  XANDER

    They're just sinners. You are sin.

    I do enjoy your sermons.

    Caleb and Buffy/First turn to look and see Buffy standing at the top of the 
    stairs. 
  BUFFY
    (cockily, hands on her hips) Hey. Heard you got something of mine.

  Fade to black.
  ACT IV:
  31     INT.     WINE 
    CELLAR AT THE SHADOW VALLEY VINEYARDS - DAY
    Buffy trots quickly down the stairs to be on the same level as Caleb.
  CALEB

    Well, if it ain't the prodigal slayer?
  BUFFY
    (looks around) Where's it at? You know I'm gonna find it sooner or later.
  CALEB
    No, you're not. I lay one hand on you, and you're just a dead little girl.
  BUFFY

    (shrugs) Lay a hand on me...if you can.
  Caleb takes a swing at Buffy, but (shown in slow motion) Buffy ducks quickly 
    and adeptly without losing balance with moves even Neo of the "Matrix" 
    would be proud of. Caleb swings at her again, but Buffy jumps into the air 
    and does a forward somersault over him, and he misses her again. He turns 
    and swings at her, but she does a forward somersault on the ground this time, 
    staying out of his reach. Buffy stands and runs with Caleb in hot pursuit. 
    She runs over the wine barrels, kicking the last one into Caleb's path causing 
    it to bust and trip him. Buffy stands and stares at Caleb.  
  BUFFY/FIRST
    (sitting on a wine barrel, looking at the wine-covered Caleb on the floor) 
    Caleb, this is getting embarrassing.
  CALEB

    (under his breath) Do you have to look like that?
  BUFFY/FIRST
    Will you concentrate?
  CALEB
    (through gritted teeth) 'Cause it's just a little confusing.
  BUFFY/FIRST

    Fine. Go. Kill. (disappears in a flash of light)
  Caleb finally gets to his feet.

  32     INT.     TUNNEL 
    - DAY
    Faith leads a group of potentials through a dark tunnel, lit only by the handheld 
    flashlights they carry. Faith points her light at a stockpile of traditional 
    weapons along with gas canisters.

  FAITH
    Everybody stop. I think we just found it.
  KENNEDY
    Look at all this.
  VI
    (grabs a sword from the pile, looks around) I don't get it. Why'd they abandon 
    all this stuff?

  A Bringer jumps down from the rafters.
  FAITH
    Maybe 'cause they didn't.
  The potentials and Faith fight the Bringers. There's not much light, and 
    it's a very confusing battle with people swinging axes and swords and knives 
    every which way. 
  Cut to:
  33     INT.     WINE 
    CELLAR AT THE SHADOW VALLEY VINEYARDS - DAY

    Caleb swings a punch at Buffy, but she jumps into the air and does a flip, 
    landing on her feet and avoiding his attack. He lunges at her, but Buffy propels 
    herself up the wall and across the rafter (ala "Crouching Tiger, Hidden 
    Dragon") as Caleb runs under her, unable to stop himself. Buffy jumps 
    to the ground and Caleb swings at her again, but she ducks and he misses her. 
    With her back to the wall, Buffy stares at Caleb as he walks menacingly toward 
    her.
  Cut to:

    Faith fights off Bringer after Bringer.
  Cut to:

  35     INT.     WINE 
    CELLAR AT THE SHADOW VALLEY VINEYARDS - DAY
    Caleb walks toward Buffy and punches, but she ducks again, causing Caleb to 
    punch his fist into a rack of wine bottles. Buffy runs up a rack of wine barrels 
    as Caleb runs toward her, then she jumps over his head. 
  Cut to:
  36     INT.     TUNNEL 
    - DAY
    Faith fights off Bringers as the other girls do their parts as well. Amanda 
    shoots a crossbow at a Bringer, but misses. Then she charges him, screaming 
    with rage and intention to finish him off. Vi fights a Bringer with a sword. 
    He has her backed into a corner. Kennedy uses her sword expertly to finish 
    off a couple of Bringers by herself. Vi gets it together and punches her Bringer, 
    knocking him down before she runs him through with her sword. Faith stabs 
    a Bringer with his own knife. 

  Cut to:
  37     INT.     WINE 
    CELLAR AT THE SHADOW VALLEY VINEYARDS - DAY
    Buffy runs away from Caleb toward the back of the cellar. 
  CALEB
    (calling after her) You whore!

  BUFFY
    (stops running, turns to face him, casually) You know, you really should watch 
    your language. If someone didn't know you, they might think you were a woman-hating 
    jerk.
  Enraged, Caleb pushes over a wine barrel and charges toward Buffy. Buffy 
    looks over in the back corner and sees an open hatch in the floor—it's 
    glowing because of the work the Bringers are doing in the room below. She 
    grins, ducks under Caleb's punch, and slides across the floor into the hatch 
    in the floor. Right as she slides in, the door shuts, and wine barrels fall 
    on top of it, holding the door down.
  Cut to:
  38     INT.     TUNNEL 
    - DAY

    Faith stands and looks around at all the dead Bringers and the potentials 
    who are still standing
  VI
    Is that it? I mean, not that it wasn't fun, but—
  KENNEDY
    Yo, Faith. Check this out.
  Kennedy is shining her flashlight at something in the corner. Faith walks 
    up to investigate. It's a doorway leading down a set of stairs. The girls 
    all go down the stairs. Faith takes the flashlight from one of the potentials.

    Buffy walks into the cave-like room under the wine cellar and stares at something 
    she sees in there.
  Cut to:

    Faith walks over a plank laid across a small waterway and sees a box that's 
    padlocked shut.
  Cut to:
  41     INT.     WINE 
    CELLAR AT THE SHADOW VALLEY VINEYARDS - DAY
    Buffy walks up to the rock where the Bringers were working before, and now 
    we see what they were after. Stuck inside the rock is a shiny weapon of some 
    sort—it's got a wide, rounded blade on one end, and a point on the end 
    of the shaft. Buffy's eyes widen as she stares at it in awe. She smiles. 
  Cut to:

  42     INT.     TUNNEL 
    - DAY
    Faith kicks at the padlock, busting it. She bends down to open the box and 
    finds a timer/detonator reading "00.08" that is wired to a box full 
    of bricks labeled "C4 High Explosive." She immediately jumps back 
    and screams to the others.
  FAITH

    (yelling to the others) Everybody get down!
  The timer counts down in seconds: 
    00.07
    00.06
    00.05
