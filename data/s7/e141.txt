  RECAP: (Skip Recap...)
  GILES (V.O.)
    Previously on Buffy the Vampire Slayer:
  1     EXT.     WOODS - 
    NIGHT
    A teenage girl is running through the woods at night, running for her life. 
    Bringers are chasing her. She sees an old pick-up truck driving down a dirt 
    road through the woods, and she runs in front of it, waving it down emphatically 
    with both arms. The driver slows and stops the truck; the girl goes to the 
    passenger door and speaks to him through the open window.
  MAN
  (wearing a black shirt with priest's collar, speaking in a southern drawl) What's 
  goin' on?
  GIRL
  Please get me out of here! (opens the passenger door and climbs in)
  Cut to:
  2     INT.     TRUCK 
    - NIGHT
    The young girl is panting, catching her breath. She's sitting in the passenger's 
    seat in an old truck beside a man dressed as a preacher or priest.
  MAN / CALEB
  Call me Caleb. Never was nobody's daddy.
  GIRL / SHANNON
  I'm Shannon.
CALEB
  Now, I want you to deliver a message for me. It's for the one and only, the 
  original slayer. 
  Caleb takes a knife and stabs Shannon in the stomach. Caleb kicks the door 
    open and pushes Shannon out.
  Cut to:
  3     INT.     BUFFY'S 
    HOUSE - NIGHT
    Buffy, Faith, and Spike walk into Buffy's house through the front door. Dawn 
    and Giles are at the dining room table.
FAITH
  Hey, got a spare bed for a wanted fugitive?
GILES
  (stands, nods) Hello, Faith.
FAITH
  Well, I guess "wanted" wasn't really accurate.
  Cut to:
  4     INT.     WORKSHOP 
    AT ROBIN'S PLACE - NIGHT
    Buffy walks up to Robin, who's trying to stand. She looks around the room, 
    then walks up to Robin again.
BUFFY
  I have a mission to save the world. I don't have time for vendettas. (walks 
  away) The mission is what matters.
  Cut to:
  5     INT.     UPSTAIRS 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Giles walks up to her as she goes into her doorway.
BUFFY
  (looks at Giles) I think you've taught me everything I need to know. (shuts 
  her door)
  Cut to:
  6     INT.     WINE 
    CELLAR AT THE SH. VALLEY VINEYARDS - NIGHT
    Buffy walks down the steps into the wine cellar, followed by Molly, Kennedy, 
    Rona and another potential. Caleb walks out into the light.
BUFFY
  Save the sermon, padre. I heard you have something of mine.
CALEB
  (chuckles) I do now. (with one powerful punch, he sends Buffy flying across 
  the room) 
  A dark-haired potential swings at Caleb, but he grabs her sword, then her 
    face, then Caleb snaps her neck and drops her to the ground.
  MOLLY
  (seeing Caleb kill the potential) No...!
  Xander is at Buffy's side as she recovers and gets back into the game.
BUFFY
  (weakly trying to sit up) Get them out of here. 
  Xander leaves. Caleb walks menacingly toward Molly, who backs up slowly, 
    frozen with fear. She raises her arm back to stab him, but he grabs her wrist, 
    then her neck. Caleb squeezes Molly's neck, lifting her off the floor. 
CALEB
  (to Molly) I work in mysterious ways. (stabs Molly, lets go of her neck, dropping 
  her to the ground) 
  Caleb grabs Xander and turns him around so he's facing Caleb. Caleb plunges 
    his thumb into Xander's left eye, gouging it out. Xander screams in agony. 
    
BUFFY
  (goes to Xander's side) Xander!
  Fade to black.
  End Recap.
    
     
  
    The Start Of Episode
  
  PROLOGUE:
  7     EXT.     STREET 
    - DAY
    A man closes his shop. There's lots of traffic and honking on the street. 
    The street is full of cars, all pointed in the same direction, but no one's 
    moving. People are even walking through the street carrying belongings. Buffy 
    walks among them, looking around, when someone in a car calls out to her. 
    It's Clem, driving a late model red VW Beetle.
  CLEM
  Hey, you.
BUFFY
  Hey.
  CLEM
  Can you believe this mishegaas?
BUFFY
  Yeah. You'd think these people had never seen an apocalypse before. (chuckles) 
  What about you? Just going for a quick spin to 7-Eleven... in Nebraska?
  CLEM
  It's getting bad here. Really bad. Hellmouth acting up again, people feeling 
  it, getting crazier. You can't swing a cat without hitting some kind of demonic 
  activity. Not that I swing cats, or eat—nope. Heh. Cuttin' way back. Cholesterol—morals. 
  I mean, morals.
BUFFY
  Right.
  CLEM
  We've seen some bad stuff in this town before but, you know, this time, it's 
  like it just seems different, more powerful. (shakes his head) I don't think 
  anyone's gonna be able to stop it. (catches himself) I mean, I'm sure you'll 
  do fine. Complete confidence in you. Heh. Uh, if anyone can do it, you can, 
  because you...rock! If you save the world, I'll come back, we'll have drinks. 
  When. When, I mean. When you save the world. (Buffy nods) It's gonna be great 
  with all the... rocking. (sincerely) Maybe... maybe you should just get out 
  of town this time.
BUFFY
  Yeah. I probably should.
  CLEM
  You take care of yourself, OK? (waves, then softly) Bye. (drives off)

  Opening Credits.
  ACT I:
  8     EXT.     POLICE 
    STATION - DAY
    Willow and Giles are talking to an officer outside the police station. The 
    streets there are chaotic too, with the honking and the traffic. Giles is 
    wearing a gray turtle-neck sweater and a black trench coat. Willow's staring 
    intently at the officer.
GILES
  Ah, thank you, officer. We—we appreciate your help.
OFFICER
  Oh, no, thank you, Inspector. We don't get a lot of contact with Interpol, so 
  we're happy to help you with anything you need. Is there anything else we can 
  help with?
WILLOW
  No. Thank you. We're fine.
OFFICER
  Right... because— Wait... Who are—who are you?
WILLOW
  (started intently at the officer) I'm with the Inspector.
OFFICER
  You're with the Inspector. Right. Well, we don't get a lot of contact with Interpol, 
  so—
  While Willow and Giles are talking to the officer, two other officers 
    escort a crazy man into the police station.
  CRAZY CITIZEN
  (rambling to himself) A single step! 
  OFFICER 3
  (to pedestrians) Stay on the sidewalk, folks.
  CRAZY CITIZEN
    A single step, and it is upon us. It is nigh! From beneath you it—
  OFFICER 2
  Freakin' nutcase.
  The two officers take the crazy man inside the police station.
WILLOW
  (looking over at the man) Ow.
OFFICER
  Uh, people are acting up, getting nuts. Man, you just let us know if you need 
  help with your guy 'cause we are itching to hand out some justice. 
WILLOW
  (looking back toward the man) He—he doesn't seem like much of a threat.
OFFICER
  (squinting at Willow) And—and you are?
GILES
  Um, I think it's time we were catching our flight to, um... Interpol. (pulls 
  Willow away)
OFFICER
  Right. OK.
WILLOW
  (walking away with Giles) Good idea. My control was fading. What's up with those 
  cops?
GILES
  Oh, same as everyone. The hellmouth is active again. 
WILLOW
  Come on. I want to get back to Xander. (they leave)
  The two officers come out of the building and chat with the one Willow and 
    Giles were talking to.
  OFFICER 2
  (looking off after Willow and Giles) Who was that?
OFFICER
  (shrugs) Um, I— I don't know.
  OFFICER 3
  (holds out a flyer) Did you get one of these yet?
OFFICER
  No. What is that?
  OFFICER 2
  Fugitive. Ran to ground right here in our own backyard. 
OFFICER
  (eagerly) Yeah? Sounds like a situation that needs some justice.
  Cut to:
  9     INT.     HOSPITAL 
    - DAY
    Buffy and Willow are talking to Xander in his hospital room. Xander's left 
    eye is covered with a bandage. Willow is sitting on the edge of his bed, holding 
    his hand. Buffy's standing, talking to him.
BUFFY
  And that you should expect to see some bruising when you remove the bandages. 
  Bruising around the— area. The, uh, bone structure and musculature was hit 
  pretty hard.
XANDER
  OK.
BUFFY
  Um, also they said that the—the meds may cause you some stomach discomfort, 
  so we're gonna have to be careful with your diet.
XANDER
  I can't taste anything right now anyway. I keep waiting for my other senses 
  to improve 50%. Yeah, they should kick in any day now.
BUFFY
  (smiling) Well, we're looking at a possible release as early as tonight. Um, 
  we're just waiting for your labs to get back, and Dr. Kallet said that should 
  be a couple of hours.
XANDER
  That's great.
BUFFY
  (nods) OK. Um, I think we're all caught up then. (holding the files, to Willow) 
  Thank you for this. This was, um, really great work.
WILLOW
    (disappointed) Oh. I thought we were gonna... (looks at Xander, then at Buffy) 
    There were gonna be card games.
BUFFY
  Oh, no, I just— I should really get back. (Willow looks heartbroken) I want 
  to get everyone started on this. I think we're really close to something.
XANDER
  It's OK. It's gotta be done. And I might see you tonight, without depth perception, 
  of course, but... still. (smiles) 
WILLOW
  (holding Xander's hand) So, I guess you're stuck with me then, huh? (tries to 
  sound chipper) Let's order some cherry-flavored off-brand gelatin, and then 
  I think we'll be up for a rousing game of—
XANDER
  I might need a parrot.
WILLOW
  Huh?
XANDER
  Well, to go with the eye patch, to really complete the look. I think I still 
  have that costume from Halloween.
WILLOW
  Yeah, and don't underestimate the impact of a peg leg. Maybe the hospital can 
  hook you up with a nice one. Maybe they have a 2-body-parts for the price of 
  one kind of deal.
XANDER
  Oh, you know what the best part is? No one will ever make me watch jaws 3-D 
  again.
WILLOW
  Yeah, and, (tries to smile) you'll never have to... (tries to stifle her tears 
  as they well up in her eyes, squeezes Xander's hand tighter)
XANDER
  (sighs, looks at Willow as tears well up in her eyes) Oh, Willow... please don't.
  Willow looks down, trying to keep her tears from falling. She's desperately 
    trying not to make a scene here, for Xander's sake.
  Cut to:
  10     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Anya is standing in front of the group of potentials lecturing while Andrew 
    stands to her side, writing key words on an easel-pad. Andrew writes "UBERVAMP."
  ANYA
  And so we know that a battle is coming. Ubervamps galore. We also know that 
  the Ubervamps are hard to kill...
ANDREW
  (writing in red) Hard...to...kill.
  ANYA
  But I have been out talking to some of my old contacts, and they've provided 
  some surprising bits of news. Yay for them! (Andrew draws a picture of an Ubervamp) 
  Uh...OK. For example, Ubervamps can be staked... right through the heart. Zing—poof. 
  (Andrew writes "steak" then crosses it out and writes "stake" 
  beside it) Just like regular vamps. Um...we didn't know this. (Andrew draws 
  a red arrow from the word "stake" to the torso of his Ubervamp drawing) 
  Of course, these guys have incredibly strong sternums, so it's a lot like driving 
  a wooden stake through solid steel. But you guys are all super-strong, right?
KENNEDY
  (scoffs) Um...no.
  ANYA
  Right. OK. Um... but still, heart information, still good to know since holy 
  water seems to run off these guys like they've been scotch-guarded. And, well, 
  sunlight would work, but guess what— they're not coming out during the daytime. 
  (Andrew flips to a clean sheet of paper and draws a yellow smiling sun) Uh, 
  also, beware of their, uh, teeth and the claws they use to shred flesh. (Anya 
  holds up her hand, fingers spread, like she's clawing and shredding with her 
  hand; Andrew writes "teeth, claws")
RONA
  OK, you know what? I used to be really afraid of these Ubervamp guys. But then 
  the scary preacher blew into town, and now I'm mostly terrified of him.
  ANYA
  (flips her note cards) Right, well, um... we're working on getting info on that 
  guy.
AMANDA
  Why bother? Nothing works. Nothing will.
  ANYA
  (shuffling her note cards) OK... I know you're all upset... and I, myself, would 
  much rather be sitting at the bedside of my one-eyed ex-fiance than killing 
  time here with you people in this over-crowded and might I add increasingly 
  ripe-smelling basement. And I would be, too, if not for a certain awkward discussion 
  he and I recently had right over there on that cot immediately following some 
  exciting and unexpected breakup sex. (some of the girls seem grossed out and 
  move off the cot; Andrew writes "breakup sex" on the paper, underlining 
  it) But...I need to give him some space... so I'm doing what I can do, contributing 
  any way I can... and so will all of you. You still need to know this information. 
  We can't stop just because something else is trying to kill you, too.
  Cut to:
  11     INT.     KITCHEN 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Faith's sitting alone on the countertop in Buffy's kitchen eating potato chips 
    from a bag when Kennedy walks upstairs.
KENNEDY
  You got enough to share?
FAITH
  Trade ya for a carton of cigarettes and some soap. (Kennedy looks confused) 
  Sorry. Habit. (Faith hands Kennedy the bag) Shouldn't you be down at Hogwarts?
KENNEDY
  (takes some chips) Probably. (hands the bag back to Faith) 
FAITH
  All right. Playin' hooky. Score one for the boarding school brat. Anya's technique's 
  probably a little different than what you're used to.
AMANDA
  (walks upstairs from the basement into the kitchen) Do you think there are gonna 
  be questions about her sex life on the test? 'Cause I really hope I don't have 
  to study all that.
FAITH
  Yeah. (grins) Whenever she starts talking about getting all sweaty with Xander 
  like that I just remind her I had him first. Shuts her right the hell up.
KENNEDY
  Thing is— what's the point? Studying demon hot zones and pressure points doesn't 
  do a hell of a lot of good when preacher man's out there, ready to finish the 
  job he started.
FAITH
  No one's come up with any info on Caleb yet?
AMANDA
  No. Nothing is working—not research, not Anya's contacts.
KENNEDY
  We're lousy with dead ends around here. (crosses her arms) Everyone's feeling 
  pretty pointless. We don't even have a place to start.
  BUFFY (O.S.)
  Hey, who's here?
  Cut to:
  12     INT.     DINING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - DAY
    Buffy comes into the house carrying the file Willow and Giles got from the 
    police. Dawn walks into the room, concerned. 
DAWN
  Hey, Buffy, how's Xander?
  Faith, Kennedy, and Amanda go into the dining room.
BUFFY
  He's doing really well. He's ready to come home, I think. (smiles, puts down 
  the file on the table, starts opening it)
FAITH
  Whatcha got?
BUFFY
  Info that Giles and Willow were able to pull off the police database. We figured 
  with Caleb's, you know, overt religiosity thing if we wanna learn more about 
  him, let's find out where he's been.
FAITH
  (reading from the file) "Incidents of violence and vandalism connected 
  to California religious institutions in the last 10 years." Looks like 
  this gives us a place to start.
BUFFY
  Yeah. I figure we start with California. We don't find anything there, we'll 
  expand the search. But a guy like Caleb didn't just get in the game. He's been 
  playing for a while, and I wanna know where. Whatever it takes. (to Dawn) You 
  good to help?
DAWN
  Well, I was gonna do lots and lots of homework, but darn the luck, they went 
  and canceled school, (Buffy hands Dawn papers) so looks like I got the time.
BUFFY
  Good.
DAWN
    (sits) Hey, Buffy... How was Xander's mood, you know, exactly? (Buffy doesn't 
    look at her) And did you get a chance to talk to the doctor about the meds? 
    Because it seemed like—
FAITH
  Hey, pipsqueak, why don't you go get some of the stuff you've already gotten 
  from Giles?
DAWN
  Or, um, we can talk about this later, maybe.
BUFFY
  (still hasn't looked at Dawn) OK.
DAWN
  Yeah. I'll be right back. (leaves the room)
BUFFY
  Try to find anything that looks like Caleb, his church, his ring... 
KENNEDY
    His ability to render a slayer useless in just one punch. (Buffy looks up, 
    hurt; Faith frowns) I didn't— that was stupid. I don't know why I said 
    that.
BUFFY
  (stifling tears, stands) Uh, it's OK. Um...you know, I—I have to go to the 
  school to pick up the rest of my stuff.
KENNEDY
  (stands) I really didn't mean—
BUFFY
  It's fine. Really, it's fine. Don't worry about it. Hey, uh... isn't Anya doing 
  that thing for you guys today?
KENNEDY
  Yeah. We were. We probably should head down there now.
BUFFY
  (smiles) OK. I'll be back soon. (Kennedy and Amanda leave; to Faith) See that 
  everyone else gets started on this. (leaves)
FAITH
  Yeah. (starts reading through the files)
  Cut to:
  13     INT.     SUNNYDALE 
    HIGH - DAY
    Buffy walks through the empty halls past the cleaned-out lockers. She walks 
    into the school office to her old cubicle and sits at her old desk. She picks 
    up a picture on her desk of Buffy, Willow, and Xander, hugging, from their 
    high school days. They were so happy, smiling in the sunshine. Buffy touches 
    Xander's face and sniffles.
CALEB
  Oh, now, look... (Buffy looks up to see Caleb standing there right in front 
  of her) Things don't go exactly your way, so here come the waterworks. Ain't 
  that just like a woman?
  Fade to black.
  ACT II:
  14     INT.     SUNNYDALE 
    HIGH - DAY
    Resume. Caleb has just confronted Buffy in her old office.
BUFFY
  Get out of here.
CALEB
  Now, now, little girl. Manners. I do imagine that firebrand tongue of yours 
  has inflamed many a man, weak as they are. (looks around) This here's a, uh... 
  public school, ain't it? Kinda deserted. Only just, I suppose. Folks work so 
  hard at keepin' the Lord out, and look what happens in return. (Buffy backs 
  up to a filing cabinet) He abandons you. (Buffy reaches for a drawer in the 
  cabinet) Not that He could do you much good now, anyway— (Caleb turns to see 
  Buffy trying to reach into the cabinet for something) Ah, ah, ah. (condescending) 
  Wouldn't do that were I you, swee'pea. Fightin' back didn't do you much good 
  last time, did it? And how is poor, sweet Xander? Let him know he's in my prayers, 
  and any time he's willin', I'm ready to... (makes a poking gesture) finish the 
  job.
BUFFY
  Go near Xander again, and I will end you.
CALEB
  (pushes over Buffy's desk violently, walks purposefully toward Buffy) Mind your 
  manners. I do believe I did warn you once. You're angry... frustrated, scared. 
  I like that in a girl. You really should relax a little. Look at where you are. 
  History's gonna look back at you, at me, at this place, and they're gonna see 
  the glory. Great things are happenin' now, right here. This school, the seal... 
  it's all gonna be a part of the great sweepin' tide of change, and you're gonna 
  be a part of it. Now, why would you wanna miss that? More importantly, why would 
  you want to get in its way?
BUFFY
  (scowls) I guess I'm just ornery. (punches Caleb in the face)
  CALEB
    (laughs) Ha ha ha! Oh, I knew you'd be a wild one— 
  Buffy kicks him, but he grabs her leg and pushes her down. She kicks his 
    shins, but he picks her up off the ground by her neck.
   CALEB
    I'm gonna take such sweet pleasure in taming you. (throws Buffy through the 
    window; she lands across the hall, unconscious) I'll see you soon, little 
    lady. (walks away)
  Cut to:
  15     INT.     KITCHEN 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Dawn and Giles are reviewing the police file in the kitchen. Andrew walks 
    in.
DAWN
  OK, well, here's the one that stood out. It's, um, a mission up north in Gilroy. 
  (hands Giles some files)
ANDREW
  (walks up to the counter) Um, Mr. Giles, Faith stole the last meatball-and-mozzarella-flavored 
  hot pocket out of the freezer even though I had called dibs on it.
GILES
  (looking at a picture, ignoring Andrew) I don't see anything.
DAWN
  Exactly. No vandalism at all. 
GILES
  Then why is it in the file?
DAWN
  The place was abandoned. (Andrew walks to the freezer in a huff) Um... locals 
  started noticing after a few days that no one was going in or out. 6 members 
  of the order lived there, but when the cops showed up... all gone. Unsolved.
ANDREW
  (grabs a box from the freezer) Yup. See, the post-it's still here: "Andrew's. 
  Please do not eat." But the box is empty now. (shakes the box)
GILES
  Oh.
DAWN
  Oh? Oh, good?
GILES
  Not sure. Here... (Giles and Dawn walk into the living room; Andrew follows)
  Cut to:
  16     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Giles walks to the desk and pulls a magnifying glass out of the drawer. A 
    bunch of potentials are sitting on the couch and chairs in the living room 
    as well, but they're quiet and solemn-looking.
ANDREW
  See, it's not the hot pocket itself— even though it did have that new-and-improved 
  thicker tomato sauce— it's just the fundamental lack of respect.
GILES
    (to Andrew) Shut up. Pay attention. (holds the magnifying glass over the photo) 
    Dawn, what do you see?
DAWN
  What am I looking for?
GILES
  On the back wall, A... knothole.
  Through the magnifying glass Dawn can see an imprint of what looks like 
    Caleb's ring in the wood on a wall next to a statue of Mary.
DAWN
  That's not a knothole.
GILES
  Amanda, would you go down to the basement and get Spike?
DAWN
  Maybe this'll help...if this does bring us closer to Caleb.
FAITH
  (walks into the room eating a pastry) Sounded like there was news. (Andrew glares 
  at her)
SPIKE
  (walks into the room) What's up... Rupert?
GILES
  Spike, I have a mission for you.
SPIKE
  Oh, really? 'Cause, you know, sometimes our missions end up with you trying 
  to kill me. I'm not fond of those.
GILES
  This is bona fide... with real ramifications. Take a look at this. (hands Spike 
  the photo and the magnifying glass)
SPIKE
  Looks like our boy's been here. You want me to go check it out? 
GILES
  I need someone who can take care of themselves in case Caleb has... left some 
  souvenirs. (Spike shrugs and walks toward the door)
ANDREW
  (whiney) Are we gonna get to the food-stealing issue soon?
GILES
  (calls after Spike) Take Andrew.
  ANDREW & SPIKE
    (simultaneously, incredulously) What?
DAWN
  Well, you are always saying you wanna get out of the house more.
ANDREW
  Yeah, but—
GILES
  There may be demons... lurking about. You never know. He's a demon expert. He 
  can help.
SPIKE
  Oh, please.
GILES
  Well, he can bring his pan flute thing along. Excellent. Off you go. (pushes 
  Andrew out of the chair; Andrew follows Spike)
DAWN
  (to the other girls) So, see? That's something, right? We'll have some news 
  soon.
AMANDA
  Sure. Maybe that'll get us somewhere.
FAITH
  (stands) Maybe. (looks at the other girls) In the meantime, the troops here 
  gotta sit and stew, feeling crappier by the minute.
DAWN
  We should keep them occupied.
FAITH
  Yeah. I know how to keep them occupied.
  Cut to:
  17     INT.     BRONZE 
    NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT
    Faith and the girls have gone out to the Bronze night club for some recreation. 
    They're dancing, playing pool, drinking and having fun while Nerf Herder plays 
    "Rock City News" on stage.
  NERF HERDER (BAND)
  (singing) Living on a wing and a prayer, out on the strip nobody cares. Scabbing 
  off a valley chick, sleeping on the practice room floor. Pretty soon the record 
  company will be banging on your door.
  Faith dances with a group of four guys. Amanda and a bunch of the potentials 
    dance together. Dawn and Kennedy are dancing together.
KENNEDY

    Buffy walks into an empty house.
BUFFY
  Hey. Guys, how's it— (looks around, realizes everyone's gone) going?
GILES
  (from the dining room) Buffy. Are you hurt?
BUFFY
  Oh... Caleb came back looking for seconds.
GILES
    My God, is h-he—
BUFFY
    Still able to make me see cartoon birdies all around my head? You betcha. 
    The short lack of consciousness was nice. I feel rested. (sits, groans) So...how 
    did those police files work out? Were they helpful?
GILES
  Uh...uh... yes. (sits) Very much so, I think. Um... there's evidence that Caleb 
  may have established a foothold up north.
BUFFY
  That's great. That's—
GILES
  I, um... I sent Spike to look into it. (sips from his mug) 
BUFFY
  Spike? Is this a mission from which you intend Spike to return alive?
GILES
  Yes. (sets down mug) I sent Andrew with him.
BUFFY
  Again I ask the question.
GILES
  Buffy, you weren't here. Decisions have to be made in your absence.
BUFFY
  Yeah, well, those are the ones that have been scaring me.
GILES
  I did what I thought was right.
BUFFY
  You sent away the one person that's been watching my back—again.
GILES
  (quickly, indignant) We're all watching your back.
BUFFY
  Funny... that's not really what it feels like. (stands to walk away)
GILES
  Buffy—
BUFFY
  Where did everybody go?
GILES
  What?
BUFFY
  Faith. The girls. Where are they?
GILES
  Um...Faith thought that the girls could do with some time off their studies. 
  I—I thought...She took them to the Bronze.
  Buffy shakes her head, rolls her eyes, and walks out the front door.

CALEB
  You know what I figured out tonight? Every high school in this country, from 
  one end to the other, smells exactly alike. Now, why do you suppose that is?
BUFFY/FIRST
    (walks out from the shadows) And how was our best girl?
CALEB
  They always think they should put up a fight.
BUFFY/FIRST
  Did you lay the proper groundwork?
CALEB
  That I did. Reckon she got the message, even if she doesn't know it yet. So 
  now the big strong slayer goes back to those girls... she's just so ready to 
  walk them right into it. And all we have to do is give her that one final gentle 
  (sticks his hand through Buffy/First's chest) nudge.

AMANDA
  (excited) This is so cool. Buffy would never let us do this. You are so cool. 
  (touches Faith's leg, turns to her friends) This woman is so cool!
FAITH
  Hey, hey, how old are you?
AMANDA
  17.
FAITH
  (takes Amanda's drink from her and drinks it) Yeah, we're gonna get you a real 
  nice 7-up, OK? 
  Faith heads back to the dance floor. Three police officers walk up to her. 
     
FAITH
    (turns, sees the police, smiles) Hey, I was wondering what was taking you 
    boys so long. Where you been?
OFFICER
  We're gonna have to ask you to come with us, miss. Outstanding warrants.
FAITH
  (playing it cool) Yeah, or we could try this one on instead. How 'bout you guys 
  buy me another drink, (hands them her drink) and we see where the evening takes 
  us. 
  One of the police officers grabs Faith's hands roughly, puts them behind 
    her, and starts walking her out. 
DAWN

KENNEDY

  Kennedy takes the gun away from the officer and hits him in the face with 
    the butt of the gun before pointing it at him. The officer knocks the gun 
    out of Kennedy's hands, but can't grab it before Amanda knocks him in the 
    head with a broom handle. On the floor, the officer tries to crawl away, but 
    Rona and Chao-Ahn kick him and then Dawn jumps on his back, kicking and screaming

    The girls rush outside to find Faith lying on her back on the ground, shielding 
    herself with her arms over her face as the police have ganged up on her, beating 
    her with Billy clubs. Kennedy and Amanda go up to the police men and throw 
    them off of Faith. Faith has a chance to get to her feet now and joins in 
    the fight against the police. She kicks a man against the hood of his car, 
    and grabs the club from another, presses it against his throat, and knocks 
    him into a wall. He sinks down to the ground. 
BUFFY
  (walks up as the fight ends) Faith! What are you doing?
FAITH
  Just blowing off steam. Well, it started that way. Turned when the cops went 
  evil on us.
  Dawn, Chao-Ahn, Rona and the other girls come out of the club and gather 
    around Buffy and Faith.
BUFFY
  Girls, go home. (glares at Faith) I need to talk to Faith for a minute.
DAWN
  Buffy, we weren't—
BUFFY
  Dawn— you, too. Go. (the girls walk away; to Faith) What is this?
FAITH
  They needed a break, all right? They've been running themselves into the ground. 
  Things just got out of hand. 
BUFFY
  Taking a break is one thing—I get blowing off steam—but they were fighting. 
  And those girls were drunk! What were you thinking?!
FAITH
  Seemed like a good idea at the time.
BUFFY
  Yeah, what if someone had gotten hurt?
FAITH
  They didn't. 
BUFFY
  Faith, I need to know that these girls are gonna be safe when I'm not around.
FAITH
  No one got hurt, B. Look, you don't even know these girls. Maybe you should 
  have a little more confidence in 'em, let them mess up sometimes, you know, 
  get down and dirty. How the hell else are they gonna learn?
BUFFY
  Learning from your mistakes is one thing. But you don't throw children into—
FAITH
  They're not children.
BUFFY
  That really isn't the point. (walks off)
FAITH
  Yeah, what about the vineyard?
BUFFY
  (stops walking) What?
  FAITH
    How safe were they when you dragged them off to meet Caleb? How safe was Rona 
    or Amanda or Molly? 
  Enraged, Buffy punches Faith in the face, knocking her down to the ground.

  It's not a road trip. It's a covert operation.
ANDREW
  Right. Right. Gotcha. (beat) I—I bet even covert operatives eat curly fries. 
  They're really good.
SPIKE
  (rolls eyes, then) Not as good as those onion blossom things.
ANDREW
  Ooh, I love those.
SPIKE
  Yeah, me, too.
ANDREW
  It's an onion... and it's a flower. I—I don't understand how such a thing is 
  possible.
SPIKE
  See, the genius of it is you soak it in ice water for an hour so it holds its 
  shape. Then you deep-fry it root-side up for about 5 minutes.

ROBIN WOOD

FAITH
  You must be Principal Wood. Heard a lot about you. (takes a drag)
ROBIN WOOD
  It hasn't really started yet, has it? 'Cause I, uh... I hate being late.
FAITH
  Troops are still gathering. I think you're safe. (nods)
ROBIN WOOD
  Looks like someone banged you up pretty well.
FAITH
  Yeah. Cops. Mostly.
ROBIN WOOD
  Mostly?
FAITH
  Yeah. (points to her cheek) This one's from someone who just thinks she's a 
  cop. It's my favorite of all my current bruises.
ROBIN WOOD
  So someone who thinks she's a cop, huh? (sits) You gonna have to, like...ice 
  her now or something like that?
FAITH
  (grins) I'm not gonna kill her. Wanted to, but didn't. By the way, bully for 
  me since no one else said it.
ROBIN WOOD
  For what? For not killing Buffy? 
FAITH
  It's this new thing I'm tryin'.
ROBIN WOOD
  (grins) She told me about you.
FAITH
  Believe every word.
ROBIN WOOD
  So what changed? I mean... why didn't you fight back?
FAITH
  (shrugs) Other things matter more. 
ROBIN WOOD
  I think you're worried about her.
FAITH
  (shakes her head) I think you need to brush up on your Buffy and Faith history.
ROBIN WOOD
  (chuckles) All right, if you say so. But I read people pretty well. It's a thing 
  I do.
FAITH
  (stands) You, uh, live around here, right?
ROBIN WOOD
  Uh, no, not exact— Well, it's the center of town, really.
FAITH
    This town, walking anywhere after dark is like an extreme sport. Someone who 
    didn't know you very well might think you were out lookin' for a fight or

  I'll buy that. You and me got something else in common after all.
  Someone jumps out of a closet as they walk past, grabbing Andrew and pushing 
    him against the wall.
ANDREW
  Spike!
  Spike pulls the robed man off of Andrew, and the man punches Spike. They 
    start to fight. Spike pushes the man against the wall, and he falls to the

  Dawn goes up to Xander and gives him a big, long, tight hug. 
XANDER
  That's fine. Parties in this house, I usually end up having to... rebuild something.
BUFFY
  Welcome home, Xander. I wanted you to be here for this. I think you'll be interested 
  in what I found out.
WILLOW
  W-what did you find out?
  BUFFY
  I-it's about the cellar. Look, I know that night wasn't fun for any of us...

MONK
  Oh... (covers the scar with his hand)
SPIKE
  Hey! Are you part of Caleb's faction?
MONK
  (shakes his head) No! No!
SPIKE
  Then tell me what happened.
MONK
  (weakly, frightened) I c-can't.
ANDREW
    (bends down to get in his face) "Can't" is a 4-letter word! I'm 
    Andrew. I'll be your bad cop this evening. You don't start singing, my associate 
    here—
SPIKE
  We're trying to fight him. Caleb. We need your help. (Andrew stands) 
MONK
  You can't fight him. You can't stop him. You can only run.
ANDREW
    (bends down to get in his face) "Run" is a 4-letter wor— (catches 
    himself ) A 3-letter word. (stands)
SPIKE
  (stands) Talk.
MONK
  I'll do better. I'll show you. (Spike offers the man his hand, helping him to 
  his feet) One night, (grabs a candelabra) some time ago, a man arrived at our 
  doors.
SPIKE
  And you said, "come in, do some damage"?
MONK
  We are—we are a benevolent order, and, yes, we welcomed him. We offered to 
  feed him... but he had come for something else. 
  The monk walks up to a statue of Mary in an alcove, just as seen on the 
    picture that led Spike here in the first place. He touches a secret lever, 
    causing the statue to swing out of the way, revealing a secret compartment 
    behind it.
MONK
  Behind this, he revealed something even we didn't know was here. A secret room. 
  (walks in; Spike and Andrew follow) He was excited, talking the whole time... 
  destiny, that sort of thing.
SPIKE
  Yeah. We hear he's a real smooth talker.
MONK
  (takes a tapestry off the wall, revealing an inscription behind it) He was going 
  on about this ancient inscription.
ANDREW
  Neat.
MONK
  He read it... and he didn't like what it said. His temper... He was the purest 
  evil I've ever seen. He burned his mark upon me. And then I ran and I hid... 
  and I listened to the others die.
ANDREW
  Running away...saved your life. (Spike takes the candelabra from the monk and 
  walks up to the inscription) What does it say?
  The inscription is Latin words written with Greek letters: Non tibi 
    est. Ei solae tractare licet.

    chair, with Dawn sitting beside him on the arm of the chair. Kennedy is sitting 
    on the sofa, with Willow sitting beside her on the arm of the sofa. Anya is 
    standing beside Willow with her arms crossed.
BUFFY
  Look, I know what you're thinking, but I had a visit at the school today from 
  Caleb.
DAWN
  Buffy, why didn't you—
BUFFY
  I'm fine. I mean, it wasn't fun, but I'm fine. I'm better than fine. I—I figured 
  something out. He kept making all this noise about the school.
ROBIN WOOD
  Is it that seal again?
WILLOW
  Do we need to try shutting it again?
BUFFY
  No, that's just it. We've spent all this time worrying about the seal and the 
  hellmouth. Why isn't Caleb guarding them? Why doesn't he have someone there 
  protecting it? Why is he camped out at the vineyard? The bad guys always go 
  where the power is. So if the seal was so important to Caleb and the First, 
  they would be there right now. They're protecting the vineyard or something 
  at the vineyard. I say it's their power, and I say it's time we go in and take 
  it away from them.
  Xander shakes his head and looks down. Giles uncrosses his arms and sighs. 
     
  FAITH
    (standing beside Robin Wood with her arms crossed) Or, in the alternative, 
    how 'bout...we don't? I mean, it's a neat theory, B, but I'm not going back 
    in that place, not without proof, and neither should you and neither should 
    they.
BUFFY
  I'm not saying it's gonna be easy.
ROBIN WOOD
  I think Faith had the floor.
FAITH
  Maybe it ends OK the way you wanna play it, but maybe it doesn't. And right 
  now, I don't think I want you playin' the odds.
BUFFY
  Did you come here to fight?
FAITH
  Listen, we're fighters, all of us, but you gotta give me something to fight, 
  something real, not—
GILES
  (softly) Windmills. (looks at Buffy) 
BUFFY
  There is something there.
GILES
  Maybe. But we can't be sure of that. This is a hell of a lot to ask.
ROBIN WOOD
  Too much.
BUFFY
  (grinning nervously, looks around) I—I don't understand this. For 7 years, 
  I've kept us safe by doing this— exactly this, making the hard decisions. And 
  now, what— suddenly you're all acting like you can't trust me?
GILES
  Didn't you say to me today you can't trust us? Maybe there's something there 
  that should be addressed.
BUFFY
  Is that why you sent Spike away, to ambush me?
GILES
  (rolls his eyes, sighs) Oh, come on. 
RONA
  You know what? I am sick of your deal with this Spike guy. This isn't about 
  him. This is about you. You're being reckless.
BUFFY
  (steps back) What?
RONA
  You are! I don't even know you, and I can tell! You are so obsessed with beating 
  Caleb, you are willing to jump into any plan without thinking.
BUFFY
  (through gritted teeth) That's not what I'm doing.
KENNEDY
  (stands, walks up to Buffy) Well, that's how it feels to us. People are dying.
WILLOW
  (stands, walks up to Kennedy) Kennedy...
KENNEDY
  (turns and snaps at Willow) Why are you always standing up for her?
WILLOW
  (softly, sadly) I'm not.
BUFFY
  What do you mean, you're not?
WILLOW
  With everything that's happened, I— (shrugs) I'm worried about your judgment.
BUFFY
  (looks around) Look, I wish this could be a democracy. I really do. Democracies 
  don't win battles. (Xander looks away) It's a hard truth, but there has to be 
  a single voice. You need someone to issue orders and be reckless sometimes and 
  not take your feelings into account. You need someone to lead you.
  ANYA
  (calmly) And it's automatically you. (looks at Buffy) You really do think you're 
  better than we are.
BUFFY
  No, I—
  ANYA
  But we don't know. We don't know if you're actually better. I mean, you came 
  into the world with certain advantages, sure. I mean, that's the legacy.
BUFFY
  I—
  ANYA
  But you didn't earn it. You didn't work for it. You've never had anybody come 
  up to you and say you deserve these things more than anyone else. They were 
  just handed to you. So that doesn't make you better than us. It makes you luckier 
  than us.
BUFFY
  I've gotten us this far.
XANDER
  But not without a price.
BUFFY
  Xander—
XANDER
  I'm trying to see your point here, Buff... but I guess it must be a little bit 
  to my left... (shakes his head) 'cause I just don't.
BUFFY
  Look, I'm willing to talk strategy, OK, I'll hear suggestions on how to break 
  this down, but this is the plan. We have to be together on this or we will fail 
  again.
GILES
  We are clearly demonstrating that we are not together on this!
BUFFY
  (commandingly) Which is why you have to fall in line! I'm still in charge here. 

RONA
  Why is that, exactly?
BUFFY
  Because I'm the slayer.
RONA
  And isn't Faith a slayer, too?
FAITH
  (caught off guard) What? Whoa, whoa, whoa. So not what I meant. I'm not in charge 
  chick. I think B here needs to just...chill out for a little bit, take a siesta 
  or something. But I'm not the one you want.
KENNEDY
  Maybe we need a vote... to see who wants Faith to have a turn in charge.
BUFFY
  (sternly) No.
KENNEDY
  No, what?
BUFFY
  No. You don't get to vote until I've had my chance to pal around, you know, 
  get everybody drunk. See, I didn't get this was a popularity contest. I should 
  have equal time to bake them cookies, braid their hair—
FAITH
    Learn their names?
BUFFY
    (laughs) You're just lovin' this, aren't you?
FAITH
  You have no idea what I'm feeling.
BUFFY
    (low, mean) Come in here, take everything that I have... You did it before. 
    Did you tell them that? Did you tell them how you used to kill people for 
    fun? Hey, you guys think that's nifty?
GILES
    Buffy, that's enough!
FAITH
  I didn't come here to take anything away from you, but I'm not gonna be your 
  little lapdog, either. I came here to beat the other guy, to do right, however 
  it works. I don't know if I can lead. But the real question is...can you follow?
ROBIN WOOD
  So we vote.
  BUFFY
    Wait. Guys— 
  Buffy looks around—Anya's crossed her arms and stares back with pursed 
    lips; Willow looks away—Buffy searches their faces.
   BUFFY
    I can't watch you just throw away everything that— (looks at Xander and 
    at Dawn, who's not meeting her glance; Buffy holds her head up high) I know 
    I'm right about this. I just need a little— I can't stay here and watch 
    her lead you into some disaster.
DAWN
    (stands, walks up to Buffy, softly) Then you can't stay here. Buffy, I love 
    you, but you were right. We have to be together on this. You can't be a part 
    of it. (Buffy blinks her eyes in disbelief) So I need you to leave. I'm sorry, 
    but this is my house, too.
  Buffy looks around then walks out the front door.
RONA
