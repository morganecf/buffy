    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Spike is sitting on the floor with his back to a chain link fence that's separating 
    one area from another. Buffy's wearing a black shirt and a scowl. Spike is 
    still sitting huddled on the floor. Alone. 
BUFFY
  Spike, this is the hellmouth. You have a soul? Fine. Show me. Get out of this 
  basement.
SPIKE
  I don't have anywhere else to go.

The Start Of Episode
  Prologue:
  4     INT.     XANDER'S 
    APARTMENT - NIGHT
    Xander's showing his apartment to his new roommate, seeming somewhat peeved.
XANDER
  You're gonna live in that small room over there. I know it looks like a closet, 
  but it's a room now. (Buffy and Dawn follow Xander into the apartment) You're 
  not gonna touch my food. I take the first shower in the morning, and if I use 
  up all the hot water, (show Spike standing at the doorway) that's your tough 
  noogies. (to Buffy) And I hate this plan. (to Spike) Are you keeping up, or 
  do you need some kind of English-to-ConstantPainInMyAss translation?
BUFFY
  (leans forward to remind Xander) Invitation.
XANDER
  (to Buffy) Is there something more emphatic than hate? Can I revile the plan? 
  Fine. (to Spike) I invite you in. (Spike enters) Nimrod. (stands in front of 
  his closet)
SPIKE
  Don't want your soddin' food anyway.
XANDER
  (to Buffy) I just don't understand when his problems became your problems—more 
  specifically mine. 
BUFFY
  The school basement is making him crazy. We can't just leave him there.
XANDER
  Why not? Crazy-Basement-Guy is better than Stalking-Buffy-Guy. 
  Spike looks down, ashamed. 
DAWN
  It's true. You guys aren't... You're not starting up again with the whole—
BUFFY
  No. A thousand gallons of no. OK, it's just—things are different now—he has 
  a soul.
XANDER
  I'm sure that'll be a real comfort when he soulfully attacks you again.
DAWN
  Yeah, what does that mean exactly—that Spike is all soul-having?
BUFFY
  I don't know, but he's been through a lot, OK, and nobody's attacking—
  Spike walks forward and touches Buffy's arm. She's startled.
SPIKE
  Buffy— Sorry.
BUFFY
  No, it's me. I-I just—
SPIKE
  I'll go. This can't work.
BUFFY
  It will. I-it already is. OK, you know, you've been out of the basement for 
  half an hour, and you've already stopped talking to invisible people.
SPIKE
  Bollocks.
BUFFY
  OK, so there was that one episode in the car, but—
SPIKE
  No, bollocks to the whole thing. I don't need your mollycoddling.
BUFFY
  It's not coddling. Now go to your closet.
  She leaves and Dawn follows. Spike sighs.
  5     EXT.     FOOTBALL 
    FIELD AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Football players are practicing while Buffy and Dawn talk on the bleachers. 
    It's a pretty, sunny day. 
DAWN
  So, what is it?
BUFFY
  What's what?
DAWN
  Last night, you said you weren't helping Spike out of pity. What is it?
BUFFY
  It's a good question. (sips her drink through a straw)
DAWN
  Is sitting there drinking soda some kind of a Zen non-answer?
BUFFY
  (puts sunglasses on top of her head) No, I just... I don't know what I'm feeling. 
  I think I can't stand him, but sometimes...
DAWN
  You love him?
BUFFY
  No. I—I feel for him.
DAWN
  Feel what, exactly?
BUFFY
  (shakes her head) Dawn...
DAWN
  No, I'm—I'm just trying to understand. I mean, none of it makes sense. First 
  you say Spike disgusts you, but secretly you two are doing it like bunnies. 
  And then Spike says he'd die for you, but he tries to rape you.
BUFFY
  (sighs) For the record, Spike knew how wrong it was. That's why he went away. 

DAWN
  But to get a soul? Like that would make him a better man? Xander had a soul 
  when he stood Anya up at the altar. And now he says he still wants her? I just 
  don't think it's the school basement that's making people crazy.
BUFFY
  (sighs) I should really get back. You comin' with? (gathers her things)
DAWN
  I just don't see why people bother. I mean, you put all this energy into chasing 
  and having and brooding and— I just don't understand these relationships where 
  you all do insane things.
BUFFY
  Bye, rant girl. (walks away)
DAWN
  Well, you could, like, paint a beautiful mural on every ugly wall in the world, 
  and then you could paint a beautiful mural on every ugly mural in the wor—
  Dawn spots the quarterback, a tall, slender, athletic blonde teenager, putting 
    on his letterman jacket after practice. The theme song from "A Summer 
    Place" plays in the background. She's mesmerized as he drinks from a 
    squirt bottle and then douses his face with water from the bottle and walks 
    off. She's watching him so intently, that she leans after him as he leaves, 
    causing her to lose balance and fall off the bleachers.
  Fade to black.

  ACT I:
  6     INT.     ANYA'S 
    APARTMENT - DAY
    Buffy's using her battleaxe to fight a demon in Anya's apartment. The place 
    is completely trashed. Anya's on the floor in the corner, crawling.
ANYA
  Maybe I'm not even the right Anyanka. Ever think about that? There's tons of 
  Anyanka's out there. Maybe one of them pissed off this, uh— what did you say 
  his name was? D'Hoffryneffer...
  Buffy and the demon continue to fight until Buffy finally hurls the battleaxe 
    at him, and it lands in his chest, killing him.
BUFFY
  Good thing I stopped by and heard screaming. (helps Anya up) So, I guess D'Hoffryn 
  decided to take you out after all?
ANYA
  Yeah. He's, uh, not head of vengeance for nothing. (gets ice tray from the freezer) 
  Well, thank you for the generous life-saving. Now please go away. (takes ice 
  and dishtowel into the other room, picks up a knocked-over chair) Look, I don't 
  need anyone's help. Or, OK, clearly I do, (sits in chair) but I don't want to 
  need anyone's help, so stop helping. (starts making an ice pack with the ice 
  and towel)
BUFFY
  I get it. After last week, you feel you need to be all renegade and broody. 
  Taking yourself out of the loop—
ANYA
  I need to figure out who I am. (puts ice pack on her leg)
BUFFY
  Another, something bad is happening. I don't want my friends out there alone 
  right now, OK?
ANYA
  Well, I-I guess you guys could use my help. Willow's not very good with the 
  practical strategizing—except when she's evil. And Dawn—she's not really good 
  for anything. 
  Cut to:
  7     INT.     HALLWAY 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Dawn is pacing back and forth in front of the stairway, psyching herself up 
    for something. Around the corner, the quarterback she saw earlier is talking 
    with some friends: another male football player and two female cheerleaders, 
    one of whom is on crutches. They are all standing in a circle in front of 
    the lockers.
  CHEERLEADER ON CRUTCHES
  You guys, I've been thinking about it, and I think I can still cheer. I mean, 
  I could use a chair or we all could, like the Laker Girls.
  CHEERLEADER FRIEND
  Oh, honey, you need to concentrate on getting better. Don't worry. We'll find 
  a replacement for you tomorrow.
  CHEERLEADER ON CRUTCHES
  I just feel like I let you down. 
DAWN
  (walks up to their circle) Hey, R.J.
  CHEERLEADER FRIEND
  Oh, Dawn.
R.J.
  Hey, Summers.
DAWN
  (they don't let her in the circle) Um, so I-I-I was wondering. You had Mr. Gurin 
  for English back at your old school, right?
R.J.
  We all did.
DAWN
  I have him this year.(uneasy silence) What a drag.
R.J.
  I actually kinda liked him.
DAWN
  Right! Right. No, no, I like him. It's just, you know, I meant drag in a good, 
  fun way. 
  JOCK FRIEND
  (ignoring Dawn) So, um, are the tryouts tomorrow? You're gonna make the new 
  girls jump up and down a lot, right?
  CHEERLEADER FRIEND
  God, gross! A vending machine fell on Cheryl and all you can think about is 
  new cheerleaders?
  Despite the fact that these people are actively ignoring her, Dawn persists. 
     
DAWN
  Hey, um, so, you know, I heard someone saying yesterday that we're gonna go 
  all the way to the championships this year. In football. 
R.J.
  Yeah, we actually have a good shot, considering we're a new team.
  JOCK FRIEND
  Yeah, well if you can get us past Highland, we've got a good shot.
R.J.
  Oh, like you could do better.
  JOCK FRIEND
  We'll see.
R.J.
  Wait, you actually think Coach'd start you at quarterback over me?
  JOCK FRIEND
  I'm just saying...
DAWN
  (impassioned) The quarterback is like the most important member of the team. 
  He is like the rudder that guides the ship.
R.J.
  Right. Could I give you a hand with that? (gesturing to the book bag of the 
  girl on crutches)
  CHEERLEADER ON CRUTCHES
  Would you really? (hands her bag to R.J.)
  CHEERLEADER FRIEND
  (catty) It's OK, she can do it herself. 
R.J.
  Hey, we're all on the same team, all right?
  They all walk off without acknowledging Dawn.
DAWN
  (under her breath) Yeah, you're all on the team. (calls after them) We'll talk 
  later, guys. That's cool. 
  Cut to:
  8     INT.     BASEMENT 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Dawn's going through boxes that are stored in the basement. Finally, she finds 
    what she's looking for after going through a half-dozen boxes.
  Cut to:
  9     INT.     GYMNASIUM 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    They're holding cheerleading tryouts in the gym. There are a dozen or so girls 
    trying out, all dressed in workout clothes, except Dawn, who's dressed in 
    Buffy's old cheerleading uniform. 
  CHEERLEADER WANNABE #1
  (cheers) Gooooo Razorbacks! (does a somersault)
  R.J.'s friend, the same girl from the circle, is heading the cheerleader 
    tryouts.
  CHEERLEADER FRIEND
  OK. Awesome. Thank you. Up next, we have—Dawn Summers. (Dawn walks to the open 
  area) Nice outfit.
DAWN
  (cheering badly) Razorbacks, razorbacks, we're gonna play, we got a secret weapon 
  and his name is R.J. Hear us cheer, hear us yell, listen what we say, razorbacks, 
  razorbacks, go R.J.!
  Dawn's cheering was abysmal. She tries to do a cartwheel at the end, but 
    falls down on her butt. R.J. was there to watch the auditions, and seemed 
    kind of embarrassed.
  CHEERLEADER FRIEND
  OK. Thank you. Very... spirited. 
  Cut to:
  10     INT.     UPSTAIRS 
    AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Buffy's standing at a door. Dawn's obviously locked herself in the bathroom 
    to hide from today's events. Dawn's sobbing audibly behind the door. 
BUFFY
  Come on, Dawnie. Come out. Dawn, sweetheart, it's not that bad.
DAWN
  (opens door) How would you even know? R.J.'s never gonna notice me now. 
BUFFY
  From what you said, I'm sure he already noticed you, I mean with the falling 
  and the—(Dawn squeaks, closes door) spirit. Spirit. They said you were spirited, 
  right? 
DAWN
  Go away!
BUFFY
  Dawn... 
  Xander walks upstairs to find Buffy. 
XANDER
  Things are a lot better, I see.
BUFFY
  I don't think tonight's gonna be good for videos, Xand.
XANDER
  Right, with the wailing and the crying... Still better than a cozy evening with 
  Spike. Shall I order a pizza? Don't teens in a snit like pizza?
DAWN
  (opens door angrily) It is not a snit! I-I finally met him—they guy of my dreams, 
  OK—and I blew it. R.J. hates me now.
  On the bathroom floor, Buffy sees her cheerleading outfit, shredded.
BUFFY
  Dawn, what is that?
DAWN
  Just the end of my life. (storms off to her room to cry more)
  Buffy collects her outfit.
XANDER
  Remember when she used to have a crush on me? I miss the much cuter "me" 
  crush.
  Cut to:
  11     INT.     DAWN'S 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Dawn is lying across her bed, listening to music. Buffy comes into her room, 
    carrying her shredded cheerleading outfit. Xander follows.
BUFFY
  You shredded my outfit.
DAWN
  I'll buy you a new one.
BUFFY
  That's not the point. I don't want a new cheerleading outfit. 
XANDER
  Now, now, let's not be hasty. (Buffy glares at him) Not the right time. 
  Buffy hands shredded outfit to Xander and sits on bed beside Dawn.
BUFFY
  Dawn, I'm sorry that you feel so bad. OK, but in the morning this won't seem 
  so terrible. You don't even know this R.J. Not really.
DAWN
  (sits up in the bed) I do know him. I know his soul.
BUFFY
  Really? Dawn, he wasn't even on your radar yesterday. 
XANDER
  It's the jacket. It's true. Something about the big letter on the chest makes 
  girls get all swoony and crushy. I saw it all the time in school. And you couldn't 
  just pin any old felt letter to your coat and get play— (catches himself) not 
  that I tried. 
DAWN
  It isn't a crush. It's love. I love R.J.
BUFFY
  Again, since yesterday. Dawn, it's awfully fast. 
DAWN
  (incensed) What? You're telling me I don't feel what I feel?
BUFFY
  No, of course not. I believe that you think it's real. It seems real... to you.
DAWN
  You know what? Maybe I don't want advice from the Dysfunction Queen. You have 
  no idea how I feel. You have no idea what real love is. Maybe if you did, you 
  wouldn't make fun of me this way. 
BUFFY
  Dawn, I'm not making fun of you.
DAWN
  Just go. Leave me alone. (flops back down on the bed)
  Cut to:
  12     INT.     HALLWAY 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    The bell rings between classes. Dawn happens to be in the hallway near R.J.'s 
    locker when R.J.'s jock friend is talking to him.
  JOCK FRIEND
  I talked with the coach.
R.J.
  Yeah? I told you man—all those fumbles in practice—he was gonna come down 
  on you.
  JOCK FRIEND
  I'm starting on Saturday.
R.J.
  Great. Who knew fumbling all the time was the key?
  JOCK FRIEND
  It's just time to let someone else have a turn, man. And you knew this was coming.
R.J.
  Yeah. Sure. (turns to his locker)
  The Jock walks down the hall toward the stairs, and Dawn follows him. 
DAWN
  You can't do this to R.J.
  JOCK FRIEND
  Oh, hey, it's you. Nice cheering the other day. (laughs)
DAWN
  It isn't fair. He works so hard.
  JOCK FRIEND
  What do you care? I mean, this is how the game is played. It's dog eat dog, 
  may the best man win.
DAWN
  But nobody's better than R.J.
  JOCK FRIEND
  (laughs) Yeah, well, that's not really up to you, is it? Hmm?
  Dawn pushes him down the stairs without so much as a blink or a flinch.
  Fade to black.
  ACT II:
  13     INT.     PRINCIPAL'S 
    OFFICE AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Dawn is sitting in the chair in front of Principal Wood, who's at his desk. 
    Buffy's leaning against a table near him. They are both staring at Dawn.
DAWN
  It all happened so fast. I mean, one minute he was walking, and the next he 
  stumbled, and then he fell.
PRINCIPAL
  Why would he say you pushed him down the stairs?
DAWN
  I don't know. Maybe he was just embarrassed. It's hard being clumsy, especially 
  when you're popular and athletic. I'd bet. 
PRINCIPAL
  Yeah, well, to be candid, it wouldn't be the first time I caught O'Donnell in 
  a lie. 
BUFFY
  It'd be nice if his lies didn't involve my sister, though.
PRINCIPAL
  Anyway, I'm gonna have to call Coach Wheeler and, uh, tell him the bad news. 
  Not a conversation I really want to have.
DAWN
  At least you still got R.J. to take over. (Buffy looks at her suspiciously)
PRINCIPAL
  Yeah. Well, I think we have everything we need for now. I'm sorry you had to 
  get involved in this, Dawn. 
DAWN
  That's OK. I'm just really sorry it happened. (stands and leaves)
  Cut to:
  14     INT.     HALLWAY 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Dawn's walking down the hall, and R.J. catches her attention.
R.J.
  Summers! Hey.
DAWN
  Hi.
R.J.
  (walking with Dawn) I heard Wood hauled you into his office. 
DAWN
  Well, yeah.
R.J.
  About O'Donnell?
DAWN
  Yes.
R.J.
  That sucks, facing the whole inquisition thing.
DAWN
  Yeah. "No one expects the Spanish Inquisition." (beat) God, it's like 
  I have a disease or something. It was really no big deal.
R.J.
  (stops walking) No. (touches her shoulder) It was. I think it's cool that you 
  faced him. Wood. 
DAWN
  We just talked. He just wanted me to tell him about... the accident.
R.J.
  Yeah. It sucks when these things just happen—out of nowhere.
DAWN
  Right. Out of nowhere.
R.J.
  (continues walking, Dawn follows) You know, I was thinking of heading out tonight, 
  after practice. You want to meet up?
DAWN
  Uh... hmm... (smiles)
  Cut to:
  15     INT.     BRONZE 
    NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
    "The Breeders" are playing on the stage. Lots of people are dancing. Buffy, Xander 
    and Willow are sitting at a table together, talking.
XANDER
  Well, Spike definitely seems a little more cogent, less (moves finger up and 
  down on lip to make sound) bl-bl-bl-bl-bl. I'm just saying... once you get back 
  the soul, doesn't that mean you start, like, picking up your own wet towels 
  off the floor?
WILLOW
  No, but maybe you start to feel really bad about leaving them there.
BUFFY
  At least he's showering, and that's a refreshing and delightful change.
XANDER
  (gesturing to the dance floor with a nod of his head) Buff.
BUFFY
  (looks at R.J. dancing) I think that's the guy.
WILLOW
  What guy?
BUFFY
  The one who, according to Dawn, is the quote smartest, funniest, coolest, hottest, 
  and having the thickest boy eyelashes boy in school unquote. 
XANDER
  He don't seem so tough.
WILLOW
  Check out the fan club.
  There's a girl dancing with R.J. She's got long light brown slightly wavy 
    hair, is slim, wearing tight hip-hugging blue jeans, and a tight, sheer blouse 
    that's off one shoulder and bares the midriff. She's dancing with him very 
    sexily, gyrating her hips and running her hands through her hair.
XANDER
  Daddy like. 
BUFFY
  What is that shirt made of? Paint?
WILLOW
  (eyes wide) Buff—
BUFFY
  Glad Dawnie isn't here to see her precious boyfriend getting all thrusty with 
  some slut-bag hussy—
  R.J.'s dancing partner turns around where Buffy can see her face. It's Dawn. 
    Buffy stares, slack-jawed, in disbelief. 
BUFFY
  Oh.
XANDER
  Oh. Oh! No! "Daddy"— No, I wasn't— When I was looking, I wasn't— 
  Oh, God!
WILLOW
  (leans to Xander) Right there with ya.
  While Dawn continues dirty dancing with R.J., Buffy's still staring in disbelief, 
    while Xander looks like he's going to gag and Willow seems ashamed of Dawn's 
    behavior.
  Cut to:
  16     INT.     BRONZE 
    NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
    Later, still at the Bronze, Dawn's walking to the bar, but Buffy catches her 
    off guard.
BUFFY
  So, do you have plans later, or are you just gonna go down to the docks and 
  wait for the fleet to come in?
DAWN
  What?
BUFFY
  (pulls Dawn aside by the arm) Where do I start with the bad? First, you told 
  me you were going to the library. Second, you do not go out on a date without 
  informing me first. Third, Anna Nicole Smith makes you look tacky. 
DAWN
  (crosses her arms) Yeah, well I think I look hot, and so does R.J.
BUFFY
  Oh, I bet he does. Maybe I should go have a little word with him. (starts to 
  walk off)
DAWN
  (grabs Buffy) No! Don't you dare embarrass me in front of him.
BUFFY
  I don't like this. This boy has you acting crazy. 
DAWN
  It's my life. I'll do what I want to.
BUFFY
  I don't think so.
DAWN
  Oh. So, what—suddenly you're Mom now?
BUFFY
  No, I'm not. And I am glad she's not here to see you like this. (Dawn stares) 
  Look, I'm sorry. I just—
DAWN
  You just can't handle it. 
BUFFY
  What?
DAWN
  You've always been the special one. Hot little Buffy with her boyfriends. The 
  Slayer. And now someone likes me, and you just can't stand that I'm getting 
  the attention. 
BUFFY
  That is the farthest thing from true.
DAWN
  No it's not. And I'm sorry, but I like the way R.J. makes me feel, and if you 
  think that makes me a slut or whatever, I don't care. (starts to walk away)
BUFFY
  (blocks Dawn) Oh, no, no, no. You are not going back out on that dance floor. 

  Dawn grabs her coat and storms off.
  Cut to:
  17     EXT.     ALLEY 
    OUTSIDE THE BRONZE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
    Dawn's walking away, still mad from her exchange with Buffy. She hears something 
    and slows down. 
DAWN
  R.J.?
  R.J.'s cheerleader friend steps out from the shadows.
  CHEERLEADER FRIEND
  I know what you're doing, slut. I saw you. I saw you with R.J.!
DAWN
  So? We were just dancing.
  CHEERLEADER FRIEND
  Right? You think I'm stupid? You're gonna back off (points at Dawn) now.
DAWN
  You know what's sad? A girl who can't move on when she's been dumped.
  CHEERLEADER FRIEND
  (grabs Dawn) He didn't dump me!
  The cheerleader picks a fight with Dawn, pulling her hair and screaming. 
    They fall to the ground. Buffy breaks up the fight. The girls stand. 
BUFFY
  (sighs) OK, first with the lap dance, now with the cat fight. Hey, you wanna 
  get drunk and barf next?
DAWN
  (to Buffy) Let go of me. (to cheerleader) This isn't finished.
  CHEERLEADER FRIEND
  I'll never let you have him, bitch. (kicks Buffy in the shin, then runs off 
  yelling) R.J. is mine. I mean it! Stay away from him!
BUFFY
  Well, at least someone agrees you shouldn't be dating this guy.
  Cut to:
  18     INT.     OFFICE 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Principal Wood is talking to R.J. outside his office door, near Buffy's cubicle. 
    Buffy's listening to the conversation. R.J.'s wearing a grey t-shirt, and 
    holding his letterman jacket by the collar.
PRINCIPAL
  How 'bout if you try doing your own homework for a change? No more getting these 
  young, impressionable women to do it for you. Avoid detention, R.J. Sound good?
R.J.
  Whatever.
PRINCIPAL
  Oh, sweet infectious enthusiasm. 
  Principal Wood walks back into his office, while R.J. starts to go back 
    to class. Buffy interrupts him. 
BUFFY
  Whoa. Hang on there, slappy. I'm not done with you yet. 
R.J.
  Oh, man. Like it's not bad enough I got that guy riding my back all the time. 
  Now I gotta deal with you, too?
BUFFY
  Actually, I'm a bit more formidable than Mr. Wood. You might come to look fondly 
  on his back-riding. 
R.J.
  Yeah, but come on—
BUFFY
  Sit. 
R.J.
  (sits in chair in lobby area) Hey, I told him I was sorry about the homework. 

BUFFY
  Mmm... not the homework, Mr. Wizard. The girls. What you're doing to them. In 
  specific, my sister.
R.J.
  Hey, I didn't do anything to your sister. And you saw how hot she looked last 
  night. I think that proved that she—
BUFFY
  (turns away, hands up, to avoid the conversation) Aah! No more with the talky. 
  Look, I know how guys like you work. You turn on the charm, you get whatever 
  you want, no matter who gets in your way, right?
R.J.
  (stands) OK, look, it's not like that. (starts putting on jacket) I just— (Buffy 
  pushes him back into the seat) get along really well with girls.
BUFFY
  Oh, I see how you get along. (turns to pace while she rants) Oh, look at me, 
  I'm Mr. Quarterback. (while Buffy's facing away, R.J. finishes putting on his 
  jacket) I crush little girls and all their little feelings. All I have to do 
  is— (turns, facing him now, and suddenly changes to a more pleasant tone) lead 
  a team of high school athletes trying their best to do a good job. Everyone 
  depending on me. That is a lot of pressure. But it doesn't mean you get to disregard 
  other people's feelings. 
R.J.
  It's not like I meant to hurt anyone. 
BUFFY
  I know. (sits on table beside R.J.) I know that. It's just— you're a leader, 
  a captain, OK? People look up to you. You need to keep that in mind when you— 
  (distracted by looking at his body) I bet you run a lot, huh? I mean, they work 
  you pretty hard, don't they? 
R.J.
  Yeah, (stands) I guess so.
BUFFY
  I get that. I do. I'm there. Or at least I was there when I was still in high 
  school. Which I was, just a couple of years ago, really. You know, I just realized 
  (blushing) that I'm basically the same age as you. I'm not really older at all, 
  actually. Just like you, (making eyes at him) but with the sexual experience 
  and stuff. 
R.J.
  I think I hear what you're saying.
  A colleague comes into the office lobby area. Buffy stands and clears her 
    throat, changing the tone of her conversation to seem more professional. 
BUFFY
  Um, right, I'm—I'm really glad that w-we had this talk, so, uh, I think you'd 
  better to get back to class.
R.J.
  OK. Thanks. 
  As R.J. leaves the office, the theme song from "A Summer Place" 
    starts to play and Buffy watches longingly, grinning like a lovesick fool.
  Fade to black.

    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Dawn's coming home through the front door as quietly as she can, but Buffy's 
    sitting on the couch waiting for her.
  BUFFY (O.S.)
  Dawn. You wanna come talk to me?
DAWN
  (under her breath) Ambush. (walks into living room, sits on couch by Buffy)
BUFFY
  I wanted to tell you that I talked to R.J. today. He's OK. I think he likes 
  you. 
DAWN
  (grinning, excited) Really? Tell me what he said about me—every word—including 
  intonation and facial expressions. 
BUFFY
  Well, he thinks you're-you're funny and-and pretty and interesting. Didn't have 
  a thing to say against you. (avoids eye contact) 
DAWN
  Yes, he did. I can tell.
BUFFY
  The tiniest thing. (tentatively) He might have said that you came on a little 
  strong.
DAWN
  Oh, my God! I'm the pushy queen of slut town.
BUFFY
  No, honey, honey, not at all. No, no. It's just—you know, lay back a little. 
  Let him come to you. 
DAWN
  I'm just scared that while I'm laying back, some other girl's gonna come and 
  sweep him up.
BUFFY
  But we have inside info. We know he doesn't like being swept. He likes to be 
  the sweeper. Dawn, you're gonna come out the winner here, with me looking out 
  for you.
DAWN
  Yeah, I guess so. Thank you. (leans on Buffy's shoulder)
  Cut to:

    R.J.'s in math class, being lectured on algebra.
  TEACHER
    So we do know that 6 x + y = 16, so we can solve for y in terms 
    of iso—  Buffy bounces into the room, wearing a black satin shirt and a short skirt. 
  
BUFFY
  Sorry to interrupt, but we need to see R.J. Brooks down in the guidance office.
  Cut to:
  21     INT.     CLASSROOM 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    In a different classroom that's not being used, R.J. looks around while Buffy 
    closes the door behind them.
R.J.
  There's no one here. 
BUFFY
  Yeah, there is. (points to him) There's one of you, (points to herself) and 
  there's one of me. (walks up to him, touching his back) You were the one in 
  math class. Tell me what that adds up to. (walks to nearby desks)
  Cut to:
  22     INT.     HALLWAY 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Dawn's walking down the hallway past R.J.'s math class. 
DAWN
  I'm not coming on too strong if I just look at him.
  She peeks in the window on the door to his class, but his desk is empty.
  Cut to:
  23     INT.     CLASSROOM 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Resume conversation between Buffy and R.J. in the empty classroom.
BUFFY
  I've always been fascinated by football. So, what's it like to lead a team?
R.J.
  The thing of it is: the time. Nobody gets how much time goes into it, with practices 
  and games.
BUFFY
  I totally get it. I was kinda juggling some stuff when I was in high school, 
  too—which was also very recent. Principal Snyder was always on me.
R.J.
  I still say Wood's the worst. You haven't seen the way that guy rides me. I 
  wish somebody'd get him off my back. 
BUFFY
  Yeah, that would be cool.
R.J.
  And sometimes, I didn't even do anything wrong—
  Buffy grabs him by the collar and kisses him passionately. They kiss for 
    a moment, then he pulls back.
R.J.
  You're like a teacher.
BUFFY
  Not really. (sweetly) But, I mean, does it bother you?
R.J.
  Not so much.
  They kiss again and lean back on the desks.
  Cut to:
  24     INT.     HALLWAY 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Dawn's found her way to the hallway in front of R.J.'s math class again. Classes 
    are out, and R.J.'s still hasn't come back to class to get his books. She's 
    distressed, and starts casually looking around for him. She peers into nearby 
    classrooms until she comes to the empty classroom. When she looks in, she's 
    completely forlorn. She runs out of the school. 
  Cut to:
  25     EXT.     COURTYARD 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Dawn's run out of the building, and sits down outside on the edge of a large 
    planter. She starts to cry when she looks down and sees Xander's work boots 
    standing there. Xander seems concerned, and sits down beside her.
XANDER
  Dawn? What's wrong? Is this— Did that guy in the jacket—
DAWN
  (crying) Uh! I don't even want to hear his name anymore!
XANDER
  I just called him "that guy in the jacket".
DAWN
  That's what I used to call him in my head before I knew his real name!
XANDER
  Dawnie, honey, you seem extremely perturbed. Maybe I should go get Buffy—
DAWN
  No! I don't ever want to see her again.
XANDER
  I thought that was about that guy in the— um, that guy with the thing. 
DAWN
  No, it's about both of them. (cries again) 
  Cut to:
  26     INT.     CLASSROOM 
    AT SUNNYDALE HIGH - DAY
    Xander bursts into the empty classroom that Buffy and R.J. are in. He starts 
    talking before he realizes what's going on.
XANDER
  Buffy, I think Dawn needs y— Uuh!
  Buffy is straddling R.J.'s hips while he's lying on top of a desk. Her blouse 
    is pulled half off, baring her shoulders. R.J.'s still fully clothed and wearing 
    his jacket. They don't get up when Xander walks in.
BUFFY
  Xander, hi. This is R.J. 
R.J.
  Hey, guy. It's called knocking.
XANDER
  (to R.J.) I'm sorry. It's just checkout time was an hour ago. We were hoping 
  to make up the bed. Also, it's a classroom, you chowder-head! (to Buffy) Now 
  get off the boy, Buffy. We're going home. 
  Cut to:
  27     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Dawn's sitting on the couch, crying while Buffy tries to comfort her.
BUFFY
  Dawn, please stop crying. Please? Crying isn't going to make his love for me 
  go away, you know.
  Pan out to show Xander, Anya, and Willow are standing there, staring at 
    Buffy and Dawn.
XANDER
  Listen, you're under a love spell. That's what this has to be. 
BUFFY
  (to Xander) You're right. He's right.(to Dawn) You're under a spell. Oh, poor 
  little Dawnie. 
WILLOW
  But we're working on it. It'll be better soon.
ANYA
  Yes. Soon neither one of you will be in love with this boy.
BUFFY
  He's not a boy.
DAWN
  What do you know about our love? It's true and real. This isn't magic. This 
  is my heart. 
ANYA
  Fine. 
XANDER
  We'll be working.
WILLOW
  Look, I know this feels terrible, but it isn't real. Try to hold onto that. 

BUFFY
  Did you hear that? It isn't real. You're just crazy.
DAWN
  It is so real! I love him. You knew how I felt—like I finally found something, 
  and you betrayed me. 
BUFFY
  I betrayed you? You're the one that constructed this elaborate fantasy about 
  you and my lover.
DAWN
  (stands) Your lover? You're lover! (Buffy stands)
WILLOW
  (mediating) Guys— Guys—
BUFFY
  I tried to get you to back away. 
DAWN
  That's right! You lied to me!
BUFFY
  Did you want me to tell you that he's in love with me? That your little crush 
  is hopeless?
DAWN
  (crying) It's not a crush! Stop. You're not supposed to do this.
BUFFY
  Why? Because he's younger than me? You know, I'm extremely youthful. And peppy.
DAWN
  No, because you were the one I trusted. (runs to her room and slams door)
BUFFY
  Dawn, wait! (Buffy goes after her)
  Cut to:
  28     INT.     DINING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    Xander, Anya and Willow are sitting around the dining room table doing research. 
    The table is covered in books and papers, and Willow's using her laptop.
ANYA
  Crazy little lust puppies, aren't they?
XANDER
  Well, at least the yelling went away. It was starting to sound like Christmas 
  morning with my family. 
WILLOW
  Love spells. People forget how dangerous they can be.
XANDER
  Hey, been there...
  Xander flashes back to episode 2x16 "Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered," 
    where lots of girls are coming after Xander in Buffy's basement. Cordelia's 
    there, not under the spell, but every other woman he knows is under the spell, 
    including Buffy, Willow, and even Joyce, Buffy's mom. They're all reaching 
    for him, putting their hands on him, completely crazy for him. Xander's remembering 
    all this fondly, with a satisfied grin on his face
XANDER
  Good times.
WILLOW
  Here. Something. (turns laptop to show others)
  Buffy walks into the room.
BUFFY
  She's locked her door. That spell has her good and loopy. 
WILLOW
  Info on one R.J. Brooks. 
BUFFY
  Oh, lemme see. Is there a picture?
XANDER
  Family stuff. Hey, I knew his brother. He was a big jock at Sunnydale High too. 
  Couple years ahead of us. He used to stick chewing gum in my hair. (Willow looks 
  horrified) Huh.
WILLOW
  What're you thinking?
XANDER
  Well, I think my relationship with R.J.'s brother was complex at best, but...maybe 
  he's a way in.
BUFFY
  (to Willow) Now, look for a picture.
  Cut to:
  29     EXT.     NEIGHBORHOOD 
    STREET - NIGHT
    Standing in front of someone's house, Xander's talking to Spike, who seems 
    a bit uncomfortable.
XANDER
  I'm just saying, we're—we're tangling with a powerful spell here. (they walk 
  up to the house) We don't know what the deal is so—so keep an eye out if this 
  guy looks twitchy. And don't let this guy charm you, either. He had everyone 
  around him practically kissing his ring back in high school.
  They're standing on the front porch now, ringing the doorbell. An angel 
    decorates the door jamb, and Spike avoids its glare. A tall, ungroomed, unathletic 
    guy answers the door in a pizza delivery uniform. Xander and Spike both stare 
    at him in disbelief.
BROTHER
  Yeah?
  Cut to:
  30     INT.     BROOK'S 
    HOME - NIGHT
    The brother is sitting slouched in an overstuffed chair. Xander and Spike 
    are sitting across from him on the couch. The room's lovingly decorated with 
    pale ivory colors, soft lighting and lace, and there are knick-knacks everywhere. 
    Each guy is drinking a bottle of beer.
BROTHER
  Construction, huh? That's awesome. 
XANDER
  Yeah.
BROTHER
  So, what's up with R.J.? How's he doing at the old alpha mater?
XANDER
  Good. It's just— (Spike stands and starts walking around the room) I know a 
  girl that might be going out with him and I was wondering—
BROTHER
  God, and you want to know if he's a good guy. Truth is, he's the best. Following 
  in my footsteps. You might not know it now, looking at me with a couple of extra 
  pounds, but back then, I was quite the guy. 
  Spike's standing at the back of the room now, near a curio cabinet full 
    of statuettes.
XANDER
  Yeah, I gather that R.J. is pretty popular, too.
BROTHER
  I gotta tell ya. There was a time I was worried about R.J. He was into comic 
  books, Model U.N., geek stuff—no offense, Harris. 
  While the brother's talking, Spike's inspecting the figurines on the curio 
    cabinet. They're all angels. Dozens and dozens of angels. He starts turning 
    them around, where they're not facing him anymore.
  BROTHER
    One time, I found all this poetry under his bed. Turns out, he wrote it. Then 
    he, uh—what do you call it? Blossomed. That's what it was like. 
  Spike's still walking around the room, looking at things. 
XANDER
  And do you have any idea why he, you know, burst into a flower all of a sudd—?
  Standing in front of the mantle, Spike's looking at the pictures that adorn 
    it.
SPIKE
  You're wearing your brother's jacket. Here, in this picture. 
BROTHER
  Oh, no, dude. He's wearing mine. That jacket was with me all the way through 
  high school. Gave it to him when I graduated, right before I started over at 
  the Pizza Barn. I'm in the management program. 
XANDER
  So, Lance, where did you get the jacket?
  LANCE/BROTHER
  Oh, dad gave it to me. Made a big deal about it, too. How he met mom wearing 
  that jacket. She was a former Miss Arkansas. Very hot in her day. 
XANDER
  (stands) Wow, that's wonderful. Boy, it's getting late.
  LANCE
  Hey, you guys don't have to take off if you don't want too. I got sort of a 
  rumpus room set up in the basement. There's air hockey and a mini fridge. We 
  could party.
  MRS. BROOKS (O.S.)
  Lance? Do you have guests down there? There's little boxes or raisins if you 
  want snacks. 
XANDER
  We really gotta go. 
  Cut to:

    Willow and Anya are still working.
WILLOW
  (sighs) Damn love spell. I have tried every anti-love spell spell I could find. 

ANYA
  Even if you find the right one, the guy would probably just do an anti-anti-love 
  spell spell... spell. 
WILLOW
  What? (doorbell rings, she stands) I'll get it. (goes to door) Maybe it's Xander 
  with some answers from the brother. 
  Willow opens the door, and it's R.J. standing there, wearing his jacket. 
    
WILLOW
  Oh, you have to be—
R.J.
  I was looking for Buffy. Miss Summers.
WILLOW
  Buffy's not here. Go away!
R.J.
  Are you sure?
ANYA
  (walks up to the door, stands beside Willow) No Buffy for you. Leave quickly 
  now. 
R.J.
  Uh-huh. OK. Tell her to call me.
WILLOW
  Man... 
ANYA
  Good thing Buffy and Dawn are upstairs. If they knew he was here...
  As R.J. walks away, the theme song to "A Summer Place" starts 
    to play in the background. Anya and Willow stare at him intently, watching 
    him walk away. Clearly, they're getting excited by this sight.

    Willow and Anya are having a spat.
WILLOW
  But you don't even know him!
ANYA
  Yes, I do. I looked into him and saw his soul.
WILLOW
  He was walking away, so unless his soul was in his ass—
ANYA
  A.J. is my best friend and my dearest darling—
WILLOW
  It's R.J. And what you were picking up on was his deep caring and devotion to 
  me.
  Buffy and Dawn walk downstairs and see Willow and Anya arguing.
DAWN
  What's going on?
ANYA
  Willow thinks she's in love with my boyfriend, R.J. 
DAWN
  What? No! You two can't do this.
BUFFY
  Willow, you're a gay woman—and he isn't.
WILLOW
  This isn't about his physical presence. It's about his heart. 
ANYA
  His physical presence has a penis!
WILLOW
  I can work around it!
DAWN
  This isn't fair! How can you all be doing this to me?
BUFFY
  OK, wait. Everyone wait. Just calm down, OK? I-I think I know what this is. 
  Clearly, you've both been affected by the same love spell that got Dawn. (Willow 
  and Anya roll their eyes)
DAWN
  Uh! This isn't a spell. He owns my heart.
BUFFY
  Dawn, be quiet. We're trying to work this out. We don't need you interfering.
WILLOW
  There's a simple answer to this. Just think about who loves him the most. Clearly 
  I do, since I'm willing to look past the whole orientation thing. 
DAWN
  I need him.
ANYA
  Well, you're gonna have to do better than that—I'd kill for him.
WILLOW
  (scoffs) You'd kill for a chocolate bar.
BUFFY
  No. Yes! Kill for him. I'm the slayer. Slayer means kill. Oh, I'll kill the 
  principal. 
ANYA
  Ooh, that is hard to top.
WILLOW
  Yeah, well I have skills. I can prove my love with magic.
ANYA
  Yeah, right. What're you gonna do—use magic to make him into a girl? (Willow's 
  eyes widen) Damn.
  Willow goes upstairs, Anya goes out the front door, Buffy goes to the living 
    room, and Dawn stands still leaning against the wall.
ANYA
  Ooh, I know what he'll like.
  Buffy turns around to get her jacket from the foyer and stops to talk to 
    Dawn.
BUFFY
  Sorry, Dawnie. You're never gonna get him.

  No. Never.

WILLOW
  Oh, Hecate, I call on you. I humbly ask your will be done. Hear my request,

  Oh, man! Now I've gotta start all over. Hecate hates that.
XANDER

WILLOW
  (stands) Proving I love R.J. the most!
XANDER
  Will, honey... R.J.'s a guy.
WILLOW
  I did notice that, yeah. 'S why I'm doing my spell, 'cause, you know, he doesn't 
  have to be. (reaches) Now, hand me back my crystals. I don't have much time.
XANDER

WILLOW
  Before Buffy and Anya and Dawn have a chance to prove that they love R.J. the

    a growling Spike tackles her before she shoots, and they fall to the ground. 
    Spike tries to walk away, but Buffy tackles him, and again they fall to the

BUFFY
  Hey! What are you guys doing?

  Locator spell. Human variety. Almost done.

    Xander pulls up in his sedan. Xander drove with Willow as passenger, and Buffy 
    and Spike in the back seat. The car stops and they all get out.
BUFFY
  You realize that Anya's probably seducing R.J. even as we speak.
WILLOW
  My God. You think so?
BUFFY
  Well, I wouldn't put it past her. She's recently evil, you know.
WILLOW
  Well, so am I. Why should I miss out?
XANDER
  Hey, crazy chicks—look. (points to Dawn)
BUFFY
  Dawn? Dawn! (runs toward Dawn)
WILLOW
  Buffy!
  A train is in the train yard now. Buffy's running alongside of it, in the 
    same direction as Buffy's running. Another train is coming into the yard in 
    the opposite direction. It's on the track Dawn's on. Buffy jumps onto the 
    train beside her and climbs up to the top of the train car. Dawn can tell 
    the train is close to running her over, so she turns her head away, clinches 
    her eyes shut and waits. Buffy jumps off the train, landing near Dawn. She 
    stands up and grabs Dawn, pulling her off the tracks just in time, as the 
    train rolls down the tracks where she was only moments before. Buffy and Dawn 
    stand.
BUFFY
  What were you doing? I mean, what is this?
DAWN
  It doesn't matter. 
BUFFY
  This is the plan? You're gonna steal R.J. by being trisected?!
DAWN
  What am I—gonna compete with you? You're older and hotter and have sex that's 
  rough and kill people. I don't have any of that stuff. But if I did this then 
  his whole life he'd know there was someone that loved him so much they'd give 
  up their life. 
BUFFY
  Dawn...
DAWN
  And it would be true forever.
BUFFY
  No guy is worth your life—not ever. 
DAWN
  R.J. is. And don't say he isn't. Look what you were willing to do.
BUFFY
  Dawn, I would give him to you in a second if I could. (crying) That's how much 
  you're scaring me. 
DAWN
  But I—I thought you wanted him... for you. 
BUFFY
  Nah. Well, yeah. My God, that boy is hot. Sorry. I think I might be under a 
  spell here. 
DAWN
  I hear ya.
  Cut to:
  41     EXT.     STREET 
    IN SUNNYDALE - NIGHT
    Xander and Spike are stealthily walking beside the display window for an electronics 
    store. They're sneaking up on R.J., who's walking down the street with the 
    cheerleader on crutches.
XANDER
  Now, you're sure you understand the plan?
SPIKE
  I think I got it, yeah.
  Xander and Spike run out into the street. Xander tackles R.J. while Spike 
    takes the jacket off of him. They run away with the jacket.
  Cut to:
  42     INT.     LIVING 
    ROOM AT BUFFY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
    R.J.'s letterman jacket is burning in the fireplace. There's music playing 
    on the radio.
XANDER
  That, my friends, is the smell of sweet, sweet, victory. 
ANYA
  Also, burning cotton-poly blend. 
BUFFY
  Xander, be honest. You didn't, you know, think about slipping that jacket on 
  just a little bit?
XANDER
  I refuse to answer that on the grounds that it didn't fit.
ANYA
  Man, this tool gets his jacket from his brother, who got it from their father, 
  and we'll never know where he got it. That bites.
XANDER
  Yeah, welcome to the hellmouth, where even outerwear isn't safe.
WILLOW
  I can't believe I almost—
BUFFY
  I can't believe I almost—
ANYA
  It was a spell. You were helpless. We're not responsible for anything we did 
  morally or, you know, legally... 
XANDER
  True. You fell for a mystical, ancient curse. Who hasn't made that mistake seven, 
  eight times?
  Buffy goes to sit by Dawn on the couch.
BUFFY
  You hear that? Not your fault.
DAWN
  (sighs) I'm just so... the way I acted, the way I talked to you. I feel so stupid. 
  All over a spell.
BUFFY
  Get ready to feel even stupider when it's not. 
WILLOW
  Hey, Anya, you never told us what you can't believe you almost.
ANYA
  (playing dumb) Almost who, now?
WILLOW
  No, you can't be the only not embarrassed one. What did you do?
ANYA
  (stutters) I, uh, wrote a poem. An epic poem... comparing him to a daisy and 
  a tower and a lake. 
  RADIO ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
  (music stops and announcer speaks) And now the latest on Sunnydale's late-night 
  bandit who is still at large. A masked thief held up a number of large businesses—
ANYA
  (turns off radio) OK, great, ice cream. My treat.
  Cut to:
